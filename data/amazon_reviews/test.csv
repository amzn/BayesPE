20957	"I purchased this unit 2 years ago.  I must say it functioned well but quit 3 months ago.  I had a 2 year warrarantee from RepairMaster but could not find anyone in the State of Minnesota who heard of or worked on EdgeStar, including Sears who works on almost anything.  I called Edgestar for the part mumbers for the compressor and evaporator to see if I could talk the warrantee people into replacing the unit, no dice.  I was told that there were not part numbers, only chinese characters.  Save a headache and stay away from this unit.

2375	I was a little skeptical that perhaps this filter wouldn't work in our GE fridge, but it worked just fine. Pay attention to the o-ring seal and make sure it's seated correctly. At first, the water seemed to dribble a little (where you put the cup to get the water on the door) but after we let it run for 5 minutes (per the directions), it worked perfectly. The water pressure is much better than the GE model (comes out much faster now) and it tastes great. I will definitely order this filter again in the future.	1
9184	no more walking ! Worth the money  .The washer has not moved any since install . It is a large heavy duty washer . I know $10 a foot seems high , but these things are the bomb , each one weighs a good bit , not a cheap plastic thing , more like something developed with the space program , no ___ !	1
9193	Filter was just perfect.  We are drinking pure tasty water again.  So easy to install.	1
6089	Update. I bought this Ice maker at the end of February 2015 and now its the end of September 2015. The Ice Maker worked great but now it will not make ice. This Ice maker died after 7 months of use. Now I have to get a new one.	0
10392	"I was so excited to get this.  Then I opened the package.  What in the world am I supposed to do with these? I could have done better with aluminum foil. This product is flimsy and does not fit the stove top.  The directions say to cut to fit.  The only reason that I'm not sending this
order back is that I followed those directs and tried to cut to fit, which did not work.  Throwing this in the garbage. Save your money and get some  Aluminum Foil Square Gas Burner Disposable Bib Liner Covers from Walmart!!"	0
36973	Do not buy this range!  3 months after warranty was up the convection fan quit.  Had a repair service come out with a repair bill over $900.  Declined to fix it.  The range is in a second residence so has been used very little.  Kitchenaid did not help out after I contacted them thru their website.	0
5064	Fit perfect, looks great, & they arrived exactly on time! Soft, pliable, & yet shiny black - (Almost deceiving, lol).	1
2262	Thanks to some other reviewers, I learned this baffle would fit my Evolution series InSinkErator disposal.  The baffle that came with this brand new disposal was impossible.  I had to push all the wet, grubby waste manually through the thing, since water pressure alone wasn't sufficient to do the job.  I can't imagine why no one at InSinkErator seemed to have tested the original baffle to learn how inadequate it is.	1
7713	Works perfectly and has DRASTICALLY improved the cleanliness of our dishes. Only con is that I thought we were getting a white one and this one is grey. Also, EASIEST installation ever!	1
39889	Not worth purchasing.  Why is this so hard.	0
2945	Fits perfect and works great	1
40492	"We bought the GE Cafe Line (range, dishwasher, microwave, and fridge) for our kitchen renovation, including the french door counter-depth fridge with the water dispenser on the inside.  A significant part of the reason we went with this line was because I dislike having the water dispenser on the front of the fridge.  The fridge looks great, and the layout of the shelves is good (although height continues to be an issue with adjustments done in increments which are too large).

We installed the fridge in mid-January and moved in at the end of January.  Immediately, the water dispenser stopped working.  Over the course of 10 weeks we had no fewer than 8 repair appointments to try to fix the issue.  Speaking to someone at GE customer service is incredibly difficult (they like their machines to do all the talking), and half the people you get are completely incompetent and/or rude.  Eventually, because we bought this through a dealer, we were able to get them to replace the fridge (after over 2 months of this with near-weekly appointments).

We had the replacement fridge installed last Wednesday.  By Sunday, the water dispenser was not working - just 5 days yet again!  We'll see how many appointments we have to go through this time, but if I could return this and have almost any other fridge at this point, I would.  It's clearly a flawed design, and I don't remember the last time I dealt with a worse customer service department than GE's."	0
12632	"Installed the two brand new filters and this is what came out right away on both filter instals.  I proceeded to re install the old PUR filter and no black water came out.  I don't know what it is but i am not risking drinking water from these filters.  Will pay for the PUR filters even if its more expensive.  *side note: box says ""manufacture in Brooklyn NY but on bottom of box it says MADE IN CHINA."	0
44387	There's no way to clear daily hi/low temp. AcuRite customer service was no help either.	0
2919	Ordered this part mostly based on price.  Package arrived within two days and was packed OK.  Install went smoothly and part is functioning fine. No complaints here.	1
592	Good product.	1
22613	this was not a replacement for my stove that's why I sent it back and  ordered  the wb30x359	0
30988	Not what I expected.	0
1142	Easier installation that we thought. Material cuts very easily to fit our gas oven. Need to remember to take it out when we do self clean, I would guess.	1
2070	Is working well. good delivery.	1
3081	awesome device.  Very easy to operate and makes great ice.  The product came quickly as promised.	1
9290	Dimensions in the product spec. is dead-on accurate.  These fit my G.E. hood just fine (it must be made by Broan).  I will be back for more when I need 'em.	1
4021	A good value compared to the big box store price.	1
3699	CAME IN LATE AND WAS DAMAGED, BUT I REPAIRED IT AND INSTALLED IT BECAUSE IT WAS EASIER TO REPAIR THAN RETURN!	0
497	Terrible water filter.  Not like the old PUR filters.  When I initially installed this, it made a loud hammering noise, I immediately removed it and re-inserted it.  That seemed to fix the noise, and the water came through fine.  Was a little slower then previously but seemed ok. However after one month the load noise came back.  Sounded like the pump was dry and hammering the air\water.  The filter was not worth the cost, and had to replace this way to soon for the price.  Ended up picking up a HDX set from Home Depot for 1/2 the cost and it seems to be fine.	0
12599	This fitting is not really universal. The hole for the RO drainage tube is tiny, I have worked with 5 different brands of RO system, and none of the under sink devices have been this small. Massively let down by this purchase - I guess this is what I get for buying online. I will buy everything in person from now on. The shipping on this product also doubles the price from about 7 dollars, to 15 - even though it weighs almost nothing and fits in an envelope.	0
13447	"This product was more affordable than the Maytag brand of filter, but there is a reason for it!  It did major damage to my 2-year-old refrigerator.  The repairs cost me over $200.  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.

I ended up throwing away the other two.  (I bought 3)"	0
8306	Best investment I've made in a long time! These are amazing and very easy to install, remove and clean.	1
2057	Works like a champ	1
6947	Perfect fit, easy repair in less than an hour. Very satisfied.	1
3781	Installed easily and it worked.	1
4869	Exactly as described. This replaced a plastic key that was stripped.	1
9253	The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is that it did arrive as described, in tact, with the clamps pictured. HOWEVER, when I pulled on it with my very minimal 110 lb strength to stretch it out, it started unraveling like an old sweater! Once the metal started to unravel, it just kept unraveling higher and higher, til I'd lost a good foot of it (luckily I bought it about 2 ft longer than I needed it). I tried cutting off the unraveled bit but it just kept unraveling...ended up having to COVER it in metal tape instead of using the supplied clamp. Hopefully it'll hold, but I'm not entirely confident.	0
42569	"It's hard to imagine something that tastes this bad is not hard on your health.  Vile.  I ran several gallons thru each, and they both made the water undrinkable.  I ended up replacing them with the orange and white filters from the local home improvement store, and life is good again.

I'd like to see whoever from Whirlpool is responsible for these being made to drink this poison."	0
4554	got in time and work as expected	1
3357	Plastic is a bit flimsy dump in a clean tub lid won't stay on I rinse a bit in bathtub then add fabric softner and rinse in washer for 6 min	1
26804	Junk - neither reading correct or even close.  Just as bad as the Avianweb Digital Thermo Hygrometer, Mini, Black which I am getting a refund for.  At least the latter I didn't have to return.	0
6569	This product completely fixed my leak. It worked perfect!!!	1
8625	It seems expensive but cheaper than the name brand at the name brand retail store.	1
524	It was a little difficult to install but was the right replacement,works great	1
236	It was exactly what I needed for the job.  Washer is working like a charm again!  Arrived a day early also!	1
14189	"I had returned a similarly priced 4-pack Sylvania small appliance bulbs to the supermarket after deciding to go with this specific GE replacement bulb for the icemaker in my GE refrigerator.  It arrived today (3/5/16) and promptly blew after I screwed it into the icemaker socket and pressed the button to turn it on.  Upon inspection, I can now see that it's not a genuine GE bulb, because the ""GE"" imprint is missing from the base.  Even though GE had sold its bulb manufacturing division, the ""GE"" imprint is still required on the base of all the bulbs manufactured as a part of the purchase agreement with the new owners."	0
278	This dyrer is really good for an apartment. I'm by myself and it does a great job. I'm so happy to have it.	1
40763	I hated the soma . The water tasted awful and actually made my dog sick. The filters are ridiculously expensive and i broke two trying to get them to work. After 4 months I returned mine to bed bath and beyond and bought my good old Brita again. Im so much happier. And the filter change reminder is new and improved! Another thing soma didn't have. Dont fall for this gimmick its costly and a huge hassle.	0
2644	"This water filter was as promised - the original samsung replacement filter.  It was easy to replace and has been working
great.  I would highly recommend this product."	1
1502	"exact replacment parts for frigidaire gallery series dryer from 1999. Dryer works great! Thirty bucks for parts and a good part of a saturday stopped the wife from threatening to go BUY A NEW ONE!  I""m good for ten more years on that one. lol"	1
2873	perfect	1
26076	doesn't fit my machine and the felt strip that goes around the frame isn't there very disapoointing	0
2842	I'll try a Home Depot generic version of this filter and your filter is a lot lot better great product will buy again !!!!	1
43375	"Use the kit that comes with the Waste King disposal , not this ""time saving"" adaptor kit.  The product description should have noted that, ""This adaptor will put your new disposal's discharge line lower than that of the existing disposal; which may require additional plumbing work than what would be needed if you chose to use the standard kit that comes with your new Waste King disposal.""  The product does allow you to use you old Insinkerator sink mount instead of the new sink adaptor kit that already comes with your new Waste King. However, the kit sets the Waste King discharge line lower than where it was in your old disposal. This change in elevation requires additional plumbing work that isn't needed if you would just use the kit that comes with the Waste King disposal. I installed this adaptor and then had to remove it because I didn't want to mess with running to the store to get extra parts to adjust the plumbing. I ended up using the kit that came with the Waste King. The kit that comes with the Waste King disposal is very easy to install and you can see the Waste King logo on it in the bottom of your sink. Why would you want to spend the money for a Waste King and keep the original Insinkerator logo that will remain in your sink if you use this adaptor? That's like buying fine wine and pouring it in the bottle of an old bottle of a $5 wine and serving it to your guests.  I am thankful for Amazon's no-hassle return policy."	0
44426	Rotating system not efficient for long hair (too weak).	0
7057	It was delivered quickly, easy to install, the price was right!	1
18790	Have the same problem with these as the originals, the plastic piece in the center keeps breaking with very little pressure.	0
44472	This appliance works, BUT it makes a very loud clicking noise during the ice making process!!!! Very annoying.	0
3264	Bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas present. It can in handy for a quick late night meal.	1
7010	Item was delivered on time and was exactly what I wanted.	1
1961	Perfect fit. Keep the extra ice stripper, they will break in time. If it does go to Appliance partspros.com they have everything you need	1
19977	I purchased the filter to replace my GE MWF in September. Well now it's January and time to change filters. When I installed the product, it made a strange sound for 15 seconds then stopped. I started to fill a glass of water. It started for a second or two then stopped and no further water was dispensed. I put the old GE filter back and the water flow was normal. The problem is that I can't return the product due to the return policy. I'll stick with the original GE product from now on	0
2645	Love them! I ordered them in black and clear. The clear is more like an opaque white. I prefer the black ones for my stovetop since they blend in quite well with the black cooktop/grills. I used the clear one between my stainless steel fridge and grey countertop and they look a bit weird, but I don't really mind bc I hate crumbs more than the gap cover looks.	1
11162	Doesnt fit, not same as original.	0
330	Seems to work as a perfect replacement for the original filter at a fraction of the regular price. Can't say how durable they are but we've had it for a few months, it's a bag of charcoal so I imagine it'll work just like the original one.	1
51856	"Bad Quality, I ordered one and after 2 weeks i see gap and due to which i see frost in my refrigerator section. Contacted amazon and they sent me a replacement however the replacement is same poor quality. does not make an air tight seal.

To my bad i did throw away my old gasket so I have to live with this poor quality product."	0
942	SIZE INACCURATE  NONE FIT MY STOVE  THREW THEM IN THE TRASH	0
1466	Easy to set up. Needs to be within 10 feet of where you are setting in a well lit room to easily see the display.	1
32755	Put it in yesterday.  Leaked everywhere and ruined my floors overnight. Have taken it out and put it back in after finding the problem and the problem continues.	0
8416	did the job and all parts as described. Lost a star due to no instructions nor packet of plumbers jelly which is needed to lubricate the pieces before being installed or they will wear out prematurely.	1
8605	"Awesome!!!

Fantastic price"	1
41177	If you get stainless steel, you'll want the real stuff.  One thing I've learned that is if a magnet can stick to it, then it is very cheap, low grade stainless.  Magnets stick to this. :( We haven't even had this a year and it looks terrible.  Lots of scratches, a dent, and hard to get clean, even with special stainless steel cleaners.  I like the fridge otherwise, but the cheap stainless looks terrible after a year.  I'd get black, or get better stainless.	0
9309	Product as described. Fast shipping!	1
6899	Sorry it took so long to review. It took a while before we were able to install it.  It was delivered in a good amount of time, packaged well. It works great!  Thank you!	1
32723	"In only a few days of use the glue (that sticks the magnetic strip) is coming off and staining my gas top.. The magnetic strip is all bent and disfigured now (assuming from the heat of the stove)..

Don't recommend it for your stove/gas.. May be hazard if the glue/magnetic strip is flammable."	0
22225	These filters do not do a thing to filter the water. I tested the water with the one year old manufactures filter then the new aqua fresh filter and the water quality was not improved. In fact it tested worse then water drawn straight from the unfilterd kitchen tap.	0
34009	The plastic coupler I got with this item that connects the hose to my faucet continually leaks nomatter what I do. The water pressure seems to suffer and the dishes do not get clean.	0
3351	I got this kit for a Frigidaire range, although the GRLP3 conversion kit is the one called for this range GRLP4 works just the same. I think it's just a matter of brand name disclosure.	1
364	"From the very start, this product was extremely slow to make ice.  Expect to wait at least 1.5 to 2 hours for the first ice drop after filling the unit with cold tap water.

Things that are different from product claims:
***  It definitely never made ice in 30 minutes; average for each ice drop is around an hour.
***  The product picture which shows it full of ice is extremely deceptive; the unit shuts off after the tiny ice holder fills (it can never actually get full of ice as pictured).
***  The product holds 1.5L of water, not 15L.
***  Convenient view window -- try as you might, you cannot see the ice through this window.
***  Claim - Produces up to 25 to 35 pounds of ice per 24-hour period.  Let's do the math.  1L of water weighs about 2.2 pounds.  It takes this unit around 5 hours to turn 1L of water into ice at the rate of 24 cubes every hour.  Let's give it the benefit of the doubt and say it can turn 5L of water into ice in a 24-hour period.  That means it is creating 12 pounds of ice per 24-hour period.  To keep the ice from melting, you need to remove the ice as it is made and place in it a freezer.  Of course, you aren't going to do that overnight, so you can count on 25-50% of the ice made in a 24-hour period melting before you have the chance to use it.  That means we're now down to 6-9 pounds of ice per 24-hour period.

We kept the unit in a temperature-controlled room that is right square in the middle of the temperature range per the instruction manual.  We cleaned the unit frequently, per instructions in the manual.  Less than two months after purchase, the unit stopped producing ice altogether (it ran, but the water did not chill).  We are still awaiting a response from the company about repairing the device."	0
37944	the stacking kit was just thrown in a envelope and literally had the trash from the missing parts in it. I used to sell appliances so i was able to make it work on my own but i was very displeased with this purchase and suggest anyone against this buyer.	0
42815	Lasted three months	0
1234	i have received two of these and both were missing parts.	0
2999	Works great, no problems with install. Fit perfect.	1
7952	The fridge is as expected. Easy installation and it keeps everything cool. So far so good!	1
25293	Installed filter about 1 month ago. Last week it was leaking all around the filter. Not very happy w this, huge mess water everywhere. Will be returning this product.	0
2349	The board arrived earlier than expected.  Well done!  Installation was easy, and programming the correct code was easy.  After this experience and reading reviews of the fridge I installed a surge protector.	1
4837	Let the rating speak.	1
49671	Please send for me another one. This one was broken already. One fan was broken.	0
27018	This does not work on the Respironic CPAP!!! My husband found out the hard way by taking it out of town with him. It would work for about 2 minutes then shut down. I had to pay 65.00 to have the correct one overnighted to him! Don't buy it!!!	0
4142	Easy to install and work exactly as they should! They just wipe off clean.	1
3734	perfect	1
8742	"I was staying at a place with no washer or dryer so I bought this because of the awesome reviews I read. It's an cool idea but my clothes came out SUPER linty and I wouldn't say it did a great job cleaning them, either. I let them dry and started picking the lint off but eventually I went to the laundromat to re-wash them.

Also, this machine does agitate but it spins in one direction so long that everything gets twirled up around itself and everything else. Then it goes the other way to just twist it up some more. I lost a few shirts to this issue. I bought a few laundry bags, small and large, to try to help the situation but the bag just got twisted in with everything else.

I really wanted this machine to work since I spent so much on it (not to mention the ""I told you so"" from my boyfriend) but I eventually tried to pawn it. The pawn shop wouldn't take it for free! I ended up giving it to an employee there."	0
23103	Wrong size, this is for the freezer not fridge.	0
1089	It worked, but it's made from pretty flimsy material and the end that attaches to the dryer was almost long enough to be attached!	0
48368	Plan on purchasing a new pair every two or three months as they fall apart quickly and the parts that break off get clogged in the pump...  So not only do you replace this flimsy you have to pull your dishwasher out to fetch the bits and pieces out of your pump.	0
3266	Replacement filter for refrigerator. Good price. Love not having to track one down in a store. I believe we have ordered twice now! Will definitely keep doing so.	1
21057	Made loud clicking noise for 6 months and then broke. Buyers beware. Bad product ordered from a bad company.	0
59488	This has never worked right from the moment it was installed. Cheap generic part- you get what you pay for I guess. Will not purchase from this company again	0
25918	could not install filter in refrigerator.  perhaps problem was lack of marking on filter body to guide insertion into frig receptacle.	0
27699	It fit the door, but keeps coming off and letting stuff fall to floor.	0
1070	Excellent product	1
6030	"An important caution. I'm sure their claims are good if you're attaching directly to stone. However, many stone countertops also have a layer of nylon/polyester reinforcement underneath. This adhesive lasts about 6 weeks attached to that. Look carefully at the underside of your counter first!

Their instructions are good, the concept is good, they installed just fine, but they need to mention that this is for adhering to stone ONLY, and not any other material."	1
34	This was easy to install, and the lights came on, and I heard the ice maker fill with water.. Then I heard the satisfying clunk of ice in the hopper... Life was going to be good.. So after about an hour I flung open the door to check on the ice makers progress... Still the same 6 cubes in the hopper... And the light on the sensor was dark.. no red light... I removed the unit, and plugged it back in.. red light came on for about 10 seconds... after that, the light was dark and the ice maker was silent... I felt like a teenage boy on prom night when his date asked to be taken home early..  What a tease.... So as any good hack ice maker repair person would do, I shorted the two wires with a paperclip and waited for salvation... I think I will order a whirlpool unit and see how that works..	0
203	Even though this has three settings for the size of ice cubes, the largest one is very small.  I like the unit but am a little disappointed by the small size of the large cubes.	1
864	"Advertised as a replacement for Samsung DA29-00003g.  It does not fit properly. Very misleading.  Do  not order these if that is what you need.
The teeth that lock it in place are a different shape so it does not seal properly."	0
5042	Perfect replacement for the old one. Came quickly and fair price.	1
309	My dryer wouldn't stop if using sensor dry; but it works fine in Time Dry. After replaced this part, every things works perfectly.	1
7924	great works wonderfull	1
7945	Thank you, took me literally 60 seconds to repair my fridge, be nice if it came with the fan, but it wasn't hard finding a fan.	1
7119	Perfect!	1
10028	There is a flaw with the spot where the rollers attach. Overtime the plastic breaks. I have owned my dishwasher for 18 months and this is the second time I have had to replace these. The part itself is easy to replace. It just needs to be made better.	0
9272	"easy to install - but needs special tool to remove screws
perfect fit but lacked rubber strip - but could be peeled and pasted from broken handle"	1
1885	Correct part, quick, inexpensive	1
12691	0 stars, for $18.82 got one flimsy test strip with absolutely no instructions how to use. Very dishonest seller.	0
8129	If you find that you need to replace the washers in your Temptrol, you are better off doing a full overhaul - hot and cold seats and installing a new spindle. I found when I tried to just replace the washers, I could not remove either one of them (larger one was under a ring that needed to be cut to get off and the smaller one was fused to the spindle) from the spindle and the seats were also very worn. The washers are included in a new spindle, so go for that instead.	1
4361	This aftermarket replacement product has been working perfectly for quite some time.  Would order again from this supplier.	1
21559	This filter says its GE but didn't work properly in my fridge. I called GE and evidently there are counterfeit filters out there. The legitimate ones have a computer chip in them that allows the water to flow with ease, unlike this filter. Don't waste your time! Order from GE.com for peace of mind.	0
3326	It's the perfect fit! My ice maker works and fits perfectly	1
8200	Great deal!	1

32092	The drum in this unit had barbs on the interior that ruined almost everything that went into it.  LG Came out to repair the unit. Never fixed it properly. The unit leaks like a sieve  and has flooded our first floor and basement.  LG apologizes on the phone but has never called back once after a dozen calls in Huntsville, AL.  Their Executive Service team is like talking into a black hole. They are very courteous but do nothing to help. They routinely fail to follow through on what they promise. Do yourself a favor and buy from another company American or Samsung that knows what it means to stand behind their product under warranty.  Good luck to all of us that bought LG. Life is definitely NOT GOOD!!!!!	0

Melts, remakes."	0
8783	Only filter our refrigerator takes, so have no choice.  It is easy to install and does the job.  Only complaint is the price, but again, the options are limited.	1
8985	Replacement matched model listed in description.  Works great and much cheaper buying in bulk.	1
7477	Loved them	1
3684	These filters seem every bit as good as the original, yet three cost less than half of one of those! I am very pleased.	1
34620	"You can't install this thing without glue, none included.  Also, there in not enough silicon in the little packs.  This is not a job to take on without some basic instructions.  I know there are various installations based on the different model washers, but at least include a basic sheet telling people what tools and procedures to follow.

Also, there were only two of the silicone packs, not three."	0
7781	Nice unit. I wouldnt use it in a high end kitchen but for a rental unit or basic kitchen  application its great.	1
9037	Part arrived on time, packaging was good,  and the part worked as advertised. Great experience.	1
7293	Exact replacement....took about 20 minutes to install....no noise from refrigerator any more....	1
5491	The machine works properly. But the ONLY problem it is not making ice cubes at all.	0
1676	I had order this product previously and I was shocked at how it has changed.  It looks extremely cheaply/poorly made. I just hope they work.	0
7485	This is highly recommended.  Top quality.  Very shiny & solid.  Don't buy that other one with plastic fittings.  This is stainless steel braided lines & the fittings feel solid.  We don't have a steam dryer, but we have a sink next to our washer that has the water lines coming off from the washer, so I am using this as a splitter  to provide new water lines over to the sink.  My husband is at Home Depot now looking for a converter fitting because the sink connections were a different size.  This kit is so good looking, I keep telling my husband it is beautiful.  With the new valves I bought to go with it for the washer it is quite fantastic,	1
33834	Design is lovely but these filters leak. My water has black stuff floating in it. What's up with that? When I contacted SOMA a few days ago, they responded with a 'we are so busy we will get back to you asap'. So what that means is their filter and pitcher are useless. I have to use Brita!	0
4896	doesnt do much for wrinkles...but it does dry pretty good.... had to get an iron.	1
52045	So far so good.  This is our third bellow installed. I thought maytag / whirlpool brand was a reliable brand but they have probably started using cheaper parts lately. This part has been definitely considered as a consumable part in our house. I purchased maytag washer in 2010 brand new.  =(	0

2223	I custom install unit on my boat in lieu of the much more expensive, marine ice maker, I replaced (best idea?, no). Some basic plumbing knowledge would be helpful to hook up unit with a 1/4 tube supplied. I also installed an inline filter as recommended and because it is on a boat. Makes a fair amount of ice although I never weighed it, when I empty the bucket into a cooler (typical use), it regenerates fairly quickly. Good looking, well made and well priced. I live in NJ and will remove the unit during seasonal layups, I wouldn't expect it to withstand winter temperature fluctuations/conditions even though under cover.	1
5153	This is a piece of crap. Yes it is the replacement-but such poor quality. Shame on Whirlpool. What a terrible design.	0
8096	Our old dehumidifier seemed to work but it still felt humid and read 45%. Before replacing I lurched this unit and it read 75%. Yeawsa!  We immediately purchased our old dehumidifier. I like seeing an independent reading. This unit has a magnetic back and kickstand which allows me to move it around with ease. I also enjoy the high and low readings for temp and humidity.	1
13612	Broke first week	0
16731	I also have this product and it is terrible.  Cannot keep it clean only cooking for 2 people.  There is no Miele name on it because it cleaned off with Miele cleaning products.  The Company only knows to charge the $200 for a call but doesn't do anything about I it.  I would think with such an inferior product they would either correct it or manufacture the products they know how to.  I only wished I had seen some of these reviews before purchasing.	0
3520	Keeps drinks cold. Fairly quiet under my bar.	1
24832	The hose was long enough and it fit fine, but I couldn't get the clamps to stay in place with my setup, so I had to use screw clamps instead. My biggest complaint about this hose is it that it's just too thin in my opinion. I felt like I had to be careful with how I handled it as I installed it. I think it might break the first time I try to clean it, so I will probably end up having to buy a new one. I'll probably go back to vinyl as that is what I had before and I was able to clean it several times before it broke. I can't recommend this product.	0
774	It just works.	1
3095	It's a good size and does what it's suppose to. Although, it would've been nice if there was an option for the background to light up when you're checking the temp at night and can't see. But overall, I'm happy with it!	1

25781	Bought washer in December 2016, it's January 2017 and after washing 3 loads, it started to leak at the bottom.  I did not over load it, as I want to take very good care of this washer.  I like how it washes and spin dry.  It works very well in that area and does get your clothes clean.  I do believe they sent me a washer that may have sat for a very long time in a hot-to-cold-to-hot weather temperature warehouse because the plastic at the bottom around the seams was coming apart and some water was there.  Also, I saw a very small but strange rust stain on the drum in the spin side.  A new washer is on the way and I will change my view after I receive the new one and see how it works.  In the meantime, I am very irritated that I have to go through this shipping and receiving process again for the washer and have to take time out of my busy schedule to make sure I am home to receive it and then package up this other defective washer to send it back.  It's time consuming.	0
8607	Does not look the same as the original but it's working	1
8352	Just replaced the filter yesterday and was pleasantly surprised to see that it fit my Amana without problem and the water tastes great. Before replacing we noticed a bad taste and odor and happy to report that this filter works very well, and is also a huge savings for this 3-pack which is less than the cost of a competitors single pack! Time will tell how it holds up but so far, so good.	1
7320	I will need to contact seller as it was missing a drain plug.  Good concept, but not very practical to use.	0

25780	Today June 8 i have received the item and read the  manual  instructions and i could  to see that the link filter is missing to the washing machine. I want to know if this part could be send or i should return  the item because without this it is impossible to use.	0
57951	"I have owned this unit for 6 months.  My prior dishwasher was a name brand that washed well for about 10 years but was very, very loud.  So when it was replacement time, my desires were for a quiet dishwasher.
The GOOD:  This unit is very quiet.  Even in a quiet room I have to be close to the unit to actually hear that it is running.  The unit has an internal filter that needs to be hand cleaned; I find that this is acceptable.
The NOT SO GOOD: The literature shows fully packed racks of dishes, but I now notice that all the dishes illustrated are very flat. The rack design is very poor for the type of dishes that I use; deep bowls and larger glasses.  None of my dishes fit securely into the racks.  The rack bottoms are not flat and the tines all seem to be too close together and too tall.  The silverware baskets are also strangely shaped and long cooking spoons fit poorly into the basket. I am not able to wash as many dishes in this unit as I was with my old unit.  The unit also leaves the dishes very wet at the end of the cycle.  The literature does warn that this should be expected, but I find this to still be annoying.
Six stars for being quiet, minus 3 stars for the rack design and minus 1 star for the wet dishes at the end of the cycle.
This unit would be perfect if it had a more basic rack design and a fan driven air drying feature. If I had a do over, I would not spend this much money for this unit."	0
6913	If you're considering a Maytag, try calling (800) 344-1274, to see what your customer service experience would be.  We've got another Maytag model with a problem, under warranty, and service has been a giant problem for us.	0
58345	"PROS
- Keeps food cold, well done Maytag.

CONS
- Will arrive wrapped in some kind of saran wrap that leaves a horrible rainbow sheen on the outside. Only way to remove the sheen it is with Goo Off.
- Top shelf is pretty much unusable due to ridiculous design innovation that involves sticking a huge control panel hanging down from the top, right in your face so you can't see or get to anything on the top shelf.
- There is an innovative shelf system, that allows the middle shelf to pop the first half of out and slide back, making for double height. Enjoy this the first three times, as on the fourth time the 0.5 micron thick plastic tabs stopping it popping out the back will break, and the shelf will fall out. It takes forever to put back in.
- Want to put gallon milk jugs in the door so you don't need to use the breakable middle shelf? Well you can in the right hand door, but in the left hand door a completely moronic design involves a gallon jug sized receptacle, fitted into a hard plastic box that is shorter than a gallon jug is high. I ended up cutting the top off with a saw. It now takes a gallon jug.
- The left hand lower door tray had a convenient ""tip"" feature. Convenient if you are looking to pour stuff from your fridge all over the floor.

This thing has been designed by someone who has never used a fridge, on acid, with a mental age of 8."	0
54608	"Ok, we bought this in 2008 when we boutght a new house. and thought we were doing something wrong with the detergent.... no the washer just does not give enough water to fully rinse no matter what you do.  In  thesake of saving water and all that ""GO GREEN""  you have to rewash this more than once. AND take it out right away.  How come I can go to a laundry mat that uses front load washers and get better smelling laundry.  THIS SUCKS.  This PRODUCT should be recalled and charged by the EPA for wasting water.  My wife screams "" I HATE THIS WASHER""!!!!!!!!!

there is nothing that LG will do about it.  Should be a product recalled!"	0

12420	"Terrible product by Electrolux.  Was persuaded to buy it over the Bosch because of its very spacious interior that allows (theoretically) us to load  more dishes than standard dishwashers.  FORGET THAT FOR A LARK! Even when it is working properly, it often ""ignores"" the top rack dishes, leaving them caked in coffee grounds and other unimaginable food items.  Thus, whenever it chooses to grace us with minimal functionality, we tend to underload it just to make sure that the dishes come out clean.  I way prefer my trusty, 14 year old Kitchenaid that has almost never let me down.

As to letting down - maybe rather than count the times the washer did not work, it might be easier to count the times it did!  6 months into ownership we are looking at an equal amount of service calls, and the motherboard already replaced twice.

Tonight is the final straw! Error lights blinking again and washer refusing to work.

Tomorrow I will not be calling my regular service people, but will be speaking directly with Electrolux.  I wish I could believe we had just bought a lemon, but after reading the reviews on this site, I am more and more convinced that we have been suckered into buying an expensive, undependable, white elephant that I wish we could dump tomorrow."	0
6665	"I am really happy with my purchase of this ice machine.  The ice maker in my 10 year old refrigerator burned out and I got an estimate to put a new one in the refrigerator. However, the price to do that was not cost effective.  I have been purchasing bags of ice for 2.29 each, sometimes twice as week (Houston in the summer!! Lots of tea, etc.).  Stopping to get ice and get it home in the Houston heat became a nuisance.  When I saw this item, I immediately jumped as it as a solution to my ice issues.  I have not been disappointed.  This ice machine is fast and I love the ""cubes"" it makes.  I have used this machine about three weeks now and I like it even more.  I fill the ice basket in my refrigerator from this machine and have not had to go get another bag of ice.  I can make as much or as little as needed to keep my supply!!

The machine is heavy and if you do not have 17"" clearance under your cabinet, it will not fit.  I live in an older ""farmhouse"" type home and there is very little counter space in my kitchen.  Therefore, I put it on its own shelf in my laundry room around the corner from the kitchen and it works great there.  It is beautiful stainless steel and the parts seem to be very durable.  The bucket in the machine is a good size and it makes the ice pretty quickly.  For my purposes, this machines has been amazing.  You will not be disappointed."	1
7106	"great product but I have to say these things are expensive.  Mine was rusted out and wasn't fixable any longer with the paint on adhesive. The new one is great  but like I said ""EXPENSIVE""."	1

6368	Perfect, Exactly what I ordered	1
22156	I have had the dishwasher since December 2014 and it has not drain consistently since the beginning either during the wash cycle or rinse cycle. GE has sent three different repair companies to replace the pump, the control panel, and ultimately the entire dishwasher, yet it still does not drain consistently. Sometimes it drains and sometimes it doesn't. I do not recommend purchasing this dishwasher. I was just online to try to see if others have had a similar issue - I do not usually write reviews.	0
3703	Bought these for my fridge Samsung RF4289HARS.  This is my second purchase.  They are OEM, and super easy to install.  The water tastes great and I have not had the slow water problem others have mentioned.  We use ours a lot (2 person household and we drink mainly water) and they last about 6 months.  Where we live, the water tastes like dirt from the tap.  I'm really sensitive to funky water, so I am so happy we bought this fridge.  The filters are well worth the money to me.  This is also the cheapest place I have found them.	1
26412	Not only did my washer & dryer come one week late, the washer had a dent on the bottom.  So much so that the door wouldn't close properly.  When I got in touch with the seller - Lincoln Direct, they said they needed photos & that they would get back to me after receiving them.  Upon submitting photos, they notified me that they didn't  feel it significant to give a refund or replace my item, at best they would credit me $100.00  I told them the door wouldn't even shut properly and that I wouldn't be able to do my wash. Then they said if I used my washer that it still might work!  I said that is not acceptable.  I was then told that they needed to talk to their supervisor and would get back to me by Tuesday (12/24).  Tuesday came and went and as of yet no one has gotten back with me.  Since this issue was not resolved,  I have filed a claim with Amazon.  This company swindles people out of their money!!	0

My dad has been using it for a few months now, and tells me over and over how much he loves it. There have been complaints of foam problems which my dad had in the beginning; however he was able to fix the problem. Great price and great gift for beer lovers!	1
2731	"This kit did the job, but like others the C-Clip gave me problems. I'm very mechanically inclined and there was simply no way the clip was going to fit. No part of the clip groove was even visible. I put some sand paper down on a flat surface, gently dragged the pulley across it making sure to keep it level, and took about .040"" off the non-cam end of the pulley. It then fit properly with the thin washer. Even after taking material off of the pulley the arrow would barely get inside the proper range when the drum started to spin, so it was obviously too tight before. Others said it will fit and be patient, that was simply not the case in my situation. I bought my washer used and it had a replacement transmission, it's possible the shaft was not protruding the proper amount. The old thrust bearing had many more washers so the old design had more adjustment."	1

22656	"Just a couple weeks before I purchased this Eco-egg washing machine, I brought a hand-cranked Wonderwash from the Laundry Althernative. It came with missing hand-cranked handle and cap and drain host (Really!?). I was disappointed and upset that because of their careless mistakes, I had to spend time dealing with the return while I should be doing laundry at home. I thought I would give the Laundry Alternative a chance to earn my trust back and place an order for this Eco-egg machine and a Nina Soft spinner. I was so excited to get the washing machine and the spinner in about a week. However, after spending all the time to get the washing machine setup done - finding the right adapter to fit the faucet and the host, adjusting the knob, so the water wouldn't leak. I was SO DISAPPOINTED to find out the machine would not work!!! It was not moving at all after the power was on, On/Off button was on, the cycle selected, and the Start button pressed. I tried the ""Full Cycle"" several times and it did not work; tried the ""Wash Only"" several times and it did not work either. Yes, it could Rinse/Drain the water without a problem. BUT WHAT IS THE POINT to have an automatic washing machine IF IT CANNOT WASH the clothing I needed it to!!! Oh, and I also found out the model does not have ""Disinfection Only"" from the user manual and the box although the label on the machine itself said it has such function. I am really disappointed at the Laundry Alternative. And now I have to deal with the return process once again but with a different washing machine. I would give the company and the product a ZERO star if I could. I have not gotten a chance to test the spinner out. I will update this review if the Laundry Alternative make it hard for the customer to return the item or if the spinner is also a lemon."	0

I purchased this from another online retailer. When switched on it did not get cold even after 2 days. I called Bosch customer services and they lady there told me call out a local service tech from Mr Appliance. I called the tech and he came out promptly and said the fridge has no freon, there's a leak in the sealed system. He said he would need to replace the evaporator but since it's a sealed system it would never be as good as new. I said ""but it's a new fridge!"". He suggested I call Bosch customer service and ask for a replacement. I called Bosch back again, however a lady there called Janice Davis (janice.davis@bshg.com) said that their warranty only covers repair and not replacement even on a brand new product! However the tech (who is not a Bosch employee) said that a repaired sealed system will never be the same as a new fridge.

Basically Bosch makes shoddy, rubbish products that look very nice but do not work at all, and refuse to stand by them. Their customer service is appalling and they simply don't care that they put out junk. I'm from the UK and there we have the Sale of Goods Act. Basically it says that you can get your money back if the item you purchased is unfit for purpose. This item is unfit for purpose, and I wish that law applied here!

56442	I just received my Whirlpool Lint Screen (#349639), and someone in shipping had folded it in half and broken the plastic sides in several places.  The box that the item was shipped to me in was of sufficient size so that the unfolded lint screen would just perfectly fit in the box.  I don't understand why anyone would fold a plastic item that didn't need to be folded.  While the mesh screen was still attached all the way around, I am fearful that the cracked plastic sides, when subjected to the heat of the dryer, are going to give way and cause the screen to come loose.  I therefore called Amazon and they issued me a credit for the item but that still leaves me short of a lint screen in good working order.

It may be okay for an icemaker but it is a terrible item to use for drinking water.  The flow rate on my drinking tap was decreased by about 90%.  It takes forever to fill a 1 gallon jug.  I also bought an extra filter thinking this was a good solution based upon the reviews I read.  It's in the garbage now (the day after the install/uninstall).	0

6584	"Washer-dryer combos are a great idea in principle, but at least in the case of this product, they just don't work.

Washing isn't a problem. It's the drying. With the Summit, you can choose among drying cycles of various lengths, but it really doesn't matter: none of them produce dry clothes.

This is especially odd because the dryer makes the clothes absolutely boiling, burn-your-fingers hot. The machine apparently lacks a moisture sensor, as the drying cycle stops after a maximum of two hours (the ""auto dry"" setting) with a drum full of wet clothes and even sometimes standing water!

We've tried drying everything from a full load of towels to a partial load of just socks. All of it comes out wet, no matter how many hours we let the machine churn.

We're debating whether to give LG's combo unit a shot or throw in the towel, proverbially, and make space in our home for a separate dryer."	0

It is a beautiful oven, it preheats quickly, convection is very even, instructions are clear, the buttons are intuitive and clear, and install was a breeze.  What can I say it is really a great product.

I have only had it for a few weeks, but we did cook thanksgiving dinner in it, multiple dishes, multiple oven settings, and it performed perfectly.

I have also checked the temperature settings against a second thermometer, and they are very accurate.

The 1 star off is for the shipping, and because the box it comes in is not designed to go through UPS (as my UPS guy informed me when after the first 2 were in pieces).  If this could go through freight it would be much better."	1
34473	"Year 2: If you run your Newair constantly (like I do) you can count on replacing the water holder  (the piece that attaches to the rotary motor pump housing) and water pump every year. Year 1 I replaced the water holder and water pump. Year 2 the water pump went out. I replaced that. Shortly after that I noticed the water holder was cracking again. I was going to try and fix it with Loctite but then the compressor went out. OK, time to replace the entire unit as in total I already spent $90 replacing parts. I decided to get the same one because all of the other brands (except one that got really good ratings but is too big) will have the same problem i.e. cheap plastic parts etc. So I yanked out all the parts from the old one that I can reuse in the replacement.

(Prior Post) I updated my review from last year. So a little over a year has gone by. The water hold that holds the water for freezing into cubes cracked down the side where it attaches to the motor. Apparently, this is a common problem. Hopped on Youtube and luckily a guy posted 3 videos on how to fix it. After spending 2 hours wrangling to get the thing out, and waiting for the epoxy to dry, I spent another hour getting it put back together. It started making ice (awesome I thought), then quit. It cracked even worse down the side. So I called today for a replacement part from Newair. $20 plus $9.95 for shipping. What a ripoff for a nothing plastic part."	0

4761	"Review of PRO366DFSVI Bertazzoni Professional 36 Dual Fuel Range, 6 Burners,
Natural Gas - Vino (Red) Color

2015-July

We have recently purchased the PRO366DFSVI (VI for Vino) but this review would apply to any of the PRO366DF (DF for Dual Fuel) ranges.

I searched online for reviews for this range before buying, and I did not find much, so I thought I would contribute here.

I did find a few reviews for the all gas version (the one with the gas oven rather than electric).  Based on those, and my speaking in person with a friend who has one, I opted for the dual fuel.  The gas ovens are reported to have a tendency to have hot spots.  My friend agreed that this is the case, she gets around it by placing a cookie sheet on the bottom rack to disperse the heat.  But I opted to spend the extra dollars for the electric range. This also added to the cost, as I had to install a 220V plugin to support it.  One of the nice things about the all gas range would be that it only requires a standard 110V socket.  So, not only is the initial cost less, the installation cost is less.

But the point of this is to review the dual fuel range, so lets move on.

I admit that I was drawn to this range because of its beauty.  It is the most beautiful higher end range I have seen.  While marketed as Pro, I believe it is not Pro in the since that Viking or Dacor or Wolf are pro.  It is not made for a restaurant.  It is made for a home, and it fits a home.  I happen to have an historic home, and it definitely fits my kitchen (especially the red Vino color) better than the all stainless steel pro models.  And lets be honest  I do not need a Pro range.  I do not cook for an army.

I was also drawn to Bertazonni due to the simplification of the range.  There are no digital readouts on the range.  No digital thermometer.  No digital control panel, no LCD screen.  It is like the ranges I grew up with. It is simpler, yet just as powerful.  For the oven, there is a control knob to set it to bake, convection bake(top and bottom burners) convection (bottom burner), broil, low (for dehydrating), etc.  And there is a knob to set the temperature.  There are two oven lights.  I read in some reviews of the gas oven, that the temperature control of the oven is a bit iffy, and one should simply buy an oven thermometer to use to verify the oven temp.  I had one already, and put it in.  In my electric oven, the thermometer is spot on with the temperature setting I have on the knob.  375 degrees is 375 degrees, etc.  Still having the oven thermometer to double check is something I would do anyway, with any oven.

I have baked meats, bread, and cookies in the oven, all quite successfully.  I made oatmeal cookies this morning, and the bottoms of the cookies are exactly the same, evenly cooked as the tops.  No darker brown on the bottom or the edges.  This is definitely better than my older, non-convection oven it replaced, where the bottoms of the cookies were always a bit overcooked.  I do use insulated cookie sheets, which may help (they are composed of two sheets of aluminum with air space in between, which is supposed to moderate the heat a bit.  In any case, the cookies were perfect.  No hot spots in the oven.

Moving on to the gas cooking top.  There are 6 gas burners of varying intensity. A rough diagram of the various BTUs of the burners is:

-- BACK OF STOVE TOP 
--  6000 -- 6000 -- 10,400 --
-- 17730 -- 6000 --  3750 --
-- FRONT OF STOVE TOP 

The 17,730 is a dual ring burner -- outer ring is 15,000. Inner ring is 2730 -- so the inner ring could be used alone as an alternate, lower simmer burner.  So we have two high output burners (one extra high) for boiling large pots of water and such.  Two low intensity burners (counting the inner-ring of the front left as one of them).  And three moderate output burners.  The burners are brass, and there are three  black (cast iron?) grates.  Each covers two burners and easily lift off.

One of the design features I really liked is that the top, under the grates, is molded of one continuous sheet of metal.  There are no seams or gloves.  This makes cleaning the top much easier.  One still has to clean carefully around the burners themselves, but there are no additional grooves to collect food and grime.

My range also came with an iron wok ring which fits over the grate of the high output burner.  I have not used it yet.  It also included a cat iron simmer grate, which can set over any of the other grates.  What this does is 1) allows for smaller pans to be set over a burner, and 2) slightly lifts the pan a bit higher from the flame.  This works fine, and I have used it with a very small pan to melt butter for instance.

One of the reviews I saw before I purchased my range, was a Consumer Reports video.  You can find it here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sxPGE-EuoE

This review was negative, and had two very silly complaints.  First, they seemed irritated that to turn on a burner one has to 1) press the control knob, 2) turn it to the left, and 3) hold it for 3-4 seconds.  This is actually a safety feature due to the thermo-coupler device in the range.  I expect, as this is a European stove, that it may be mandatory in some countries over there.  In the states, we use thermo-couplers, for instance, in our gas water heaters.  Its a purely mechanical (no electricty involved) device that will shut off the gas if the flame goes out.  It uses the fact that metal expands when heated and contracts when cooled.  When the thermo-coupler contracts, it shuts off the gas.  Thus if the pilot light on your gas water heater goes out, the gas will also shut off (independent of any human shutting it off, or requiring electricity to do so), and your house will not fill with gas.  The same device is used on the Bertazzoni burners, hence one needs to hold the knob in for a few seconds as the thermo-coupler heats up.  Compare this to typical gas ranges in the states, where if the flame goes out, the gas will continue to flow.

Why CR reports this as a negative, when they must know the purpose, is not understandable to me.

They also complained about having to light two separate burners (inner and outer) on the high output burner.  Taking yet another 4 seconds seems an inconvenience of some sort.  Yet, they don't mention that having the two rings provides versatility.  One can access to 15,000 BTU with just one ring, or to a low output 2,730 BTU with the inner.  Kudos for versatility.

They also mentioned that the oven was small  but they reviewed the 4 burner not the 6 burner.  My oven on the 6 burner range is definitely large, using my yardstick, I measure it at 18"" deep, 27"" wide, and 13"" high.  Definitely big enough for a Thanksgiving turkey.

Another complaint about the stove, that is based on the design (as were the CR complaints) is that when the oven is on, it blows air out the front.  I can confirm that it definitely does.  I expect that one purpose of this is to keep the front of the oven, where one places hands, warm rather than getting too hot.  Im not sure what all the design functionality of this is.  It is different from my old range, but it is not bothersome.  We are in the midst of summer, and it is not overheating the kitchen.  Yes, it will heat it up a bit more, but just running any oven will also do that.  But be aware that this design feature does exist on this range.  One user complained that the vented air was hot enough to melt plastic.  This is definitely not the case at all.  Nothing gets too hot when I use this oven.

What else can I think of.  Oh yeah, Bertazzoni was running a sale this year, where if you buy a range, they throw in the exhaust hood for free.  I took advantage of that, as the price of the ranges seems to be set the same everywhere.  That is, my range cost the same whether I buy it online (from any of several sites) or from my local appliance store (Kellys in Salem, Oregon).  I chose the latter, I like dealing face to face with people.

Oh, one other thing that I have yet to experience, but I expect to at some.  Earlier I mentioned that this is simpler range than many modern ranges.  No complicated electronics panel.  Less things to break.  When things break, I can replace more of the parts on this oven than I could on other modern ranges.  This is a selling point for me.  Remember my friend who I asked about the hot spots in her gas oven.  She is still happy with that all gas stove, but she mentioned that one of the things that are prone to failing are the thermo-couplers.  However, she was able to order it and and install it herself quite easily. The manual also have instructions for replacing the burners.  If you are the type of person who may want to save the cost of a service call by performing such maintenance yourself, this range may work for you.

11993	Water tasted terrible so I returned the filter with no issues. Free return shipping. I got the one in the photo instead. The h2o that comes out is superb	0
7473	love this range hood! a bit bigger in depth and height than many under-cabinet vent hoods, but I really like the power and great light that this thing puts out. followed another reviewer's example and put in LEDs instead of halogens - they are not dimmable and so do not work on the middle light switch setting, but I probably should've realized that before I installed them and trashed the packaging. the light is super bright, so I may switch back to dimmable halogens at some point. took me about an hour to install, but that was mostly due to having a pregnant wife for a helper and it taking us a bit to figure out our method. it came well-packaged and undamaged. overall, I'm very satisfied with this hood.	1
8869	I melted my last probe by accident after 12 years of using it regularly and we were very pleased to find this affordable and exact brand replacement.  Works perfectly!  Everything is cooked to the right temperature and not overdone!  Love having quality replacement parts for large home appliances available.	1

43832	"Don't buy this!!!
I bought a 2 pack of these and I'm already on my second one in 3 weeks.  The water tastes like plastic/chemicals/salty.
The instructions said to pass 2-3 gallons of water through it.  We went through almost 9 gallons of water and it still looks cloudy.  I can't tell if it's air bubbles or powder.  Our ice looks the same way.  I had to turn off my ice maker.
Normally for new filters from Loews, it should only take 4-5 gallons before it's drinkable, and it should turn clear.  I thought the first one was bad do I threw it away.  The second one is doing the SAME thing.
I am very disappointed, and will never buy again.  Shame I can't get a refund."	0

1508	Lifesaver. Well not really but apparently gone are the days when one with even a modicum of skill could change their dryer form back- to side-exhaust. Apparently with newer models require a service tech (5-7 day wait) and $175 to do the change. This lets you mount the dryer almost flush with the wall.	1

Service has been called (AGAIN) and it has taken 5 days (3 business days) to get someone out to look at it.

If you buy this, be sure you've got a backup because my experience is that it won't work."	0

8566	These filters work great, and I've seen some people complain that they don't last very long, but water is so naturally corrosive, how long do you imagine these to last? Six months? No, and we don't want our kid breathing the humidity that this thing would put out after that long. We clean them out after about four weeks, flip them over, and use them another couple weeks. Then we buy more. You'll notice how the water usage goes down and that's how you'll know to replace it or clean it and buy another one. We love these filters, and have no problems with them at all. Enjoy!	1
4189	Buy the one with the improved attached harness or wire (Whirlpool W10258275).  The poor connection contributes to over heating.	0
9221	"used this to replace my old dryer vent that vents out the side of my house. I chose this one because:

1) it was cheap
2) it was the exact replacement and size of the one i am replacing.
3) it has a pest and rodent cover on it so that mice and other vermin will not get into my dryer duct.
4) the cover is easily removable. it takes me all of 10 seconds to pop in the little plastic tabs and remove it. cleaning it is a breeze and this is a great option.

no specific cons that i can think of other than that it doesnt come with any screws or anything to fasten the mouth to the wall."	1
1323	Flow rate is great - faster than the OEM GE filter at 1/3rd the price. Water tastes just as good as that from the OEM filter. Understand this doesn't filter lead etc but we are relying on our township to do that.	1
1039	works very well. Always clean your dryer vent and inside and the vent hose too.	1
58234	In the past, I've had good experience with Whirlpool filters. This one, however seems to be defective. The water flow is UNBEARABLY slow (it takes literally 3 minutes to fill a 24 oz bottle), and after being installed for about 5 weeks, it already says the filter only has 55 remaining. This for a filter that is supposed to last 6 months! Of course, because I didn't install it immediately after receiving it and was waiting to see if the problem resolved, my return window is now closed. Whirlpool won't replace it because I ordered it from Amazon, and Amazon is impossible to contact after the return window is closed. So, I spent 45 bucks for a headache. I'll be getting my filters directly from Whirlpool in the future.	0
42011	Too expensive, should have tried a substitute.  We'll do that next time.	0
2530	Just what I needed at a great price!	1
2899	"I've tried other means of controlling bacterial growth in my Honeywell QuietCare humidifier, but they have lacked.  Bleach is dangerous and has a scent.  Protec cartridges (the ones with silver in them) do not work sufficiently.

On the other hand, this BestAir stuff works very well, much better than alternatives I have tried.  It has very little scent.  Moreover, it is potent and so this bottle will easily last this winter, next, and perhaps after that.  Furthermore, I think some of the product remains in the filter, and so I only add the recommended amount to every other tank, and the results have been good. As a by-product of its effectiveness, my filter is (so far) lasting longer than before---but that performance might depend on your water-hardness, so mileage varies."	1
7979	Turns out my old ice assembly wasn't 100% my problem.  Once installed, I discovered the ice maker isn't getting water which was unexpected since my last assembly died with ice in the molds not yet ejected.  My new water valve is on the way however, I've been adding water to the new assembly manually and the ice is filling up the basket just fine.  I'll give it 5 stars once I see the water gets to the molds ok.	1
9647	"I put a ""1"" star because it is the lowest I could enter.  The first one I installed worked for a couple weeks of daily, regular use and then the water started smelling like dirty feet.  So I contacted the manufacturer and they promptly responded.  They shipped me another one quickly and I changed it out.  Again, in a couple weeks the water smelled like dirty feet.  I then went and ordered the original LG water filter and it still works fine, no smell.  Not sure what the problem is with these but I was not happy and it was a waste of my money."	0
59838	Knobs did not fit the stove	0
4604	Just bought them for when I need a new one....purchased my current 1 at Home Depot for $45 dollars...so what I paid for 3 is a far better deal!!	1
7605	Exactly the part I needed and cheaper than the Whirlpool site.	1
14857	"In the 18 months we have owned this it has flipped the circuit breaker twice (apparently it has faulty wiring inside somewhere) the top oven stopped heating and we need a new element, and we learned during a blizzard that it does not work when the power goes out, which is pretty much the only reason left to buy a gas stove.

Edit: my short review left out a key fact so I will clarify: this model automatically shuts off the gas supply when the power it off as a ""safety feature."" The only way to to reactivate the gas supply is to regain power and then the display will tell you to turn the knobs off and to press a button that doesn't actually exist (the ""cancel"" button) to turn the gas back on. After a few tries I found the ""lower oven off"" button turns the gas on again.

The fact that the very first thing this oven says to a new owner is to press a non-existent button tells you everything you need to know about how much KitchenAid cares about product testing or attention to detail."	0
7329	Mini-fridge now functions.	1
3977	"This is a mixed review. .. When I got the ice maker I was in love. I LOVE ice.. and it was making ice like a champ for about one month then slowly it started making half the cubes.. then 4 cubes.. then very thin see through cubes... to none. I will however say that the company has been very receptive to my returning it to be repaired. .. returning is always a pain in the butt and it seems so that a brandy new product should not be having any problems. Will letchu know how the ""repair"" turns out."	0
25225	"I bought this in Feb 2016, so I have used it for a good 14 months now. The first problem is the oven does not always stay on after lighting. This is very irritating when you when you ""think"" you are pre-heating the oven and it is actually not on! Secondly, there is only one high temp burner, so forget about cooking a pot of water for pasta AND something else at the same time. Thirdly, the knobs are very cheap and easily moved so if you set an oven temperature and bump into the knob, it may no longer be set at the desired temperature. Finally, one of the burner knobs just broke. So....good luck if you buy this oven and expect to cook!"	0
32970	"I got what I thought was a great deal.  It was only used a couple of months and the people ""remodeled"" so they upgraded to a larger unit. Yeah.  First the doors just don't like to be shut.  That's why GE put a buzzer on it.  Second the drain gets plugged and it is a bear to remove the freezer drawers and the interior freezer back panel to clean it out.  Why hide it behind a panel?  It's noisy, has cheap refrigerator drawers.  The only thing good is it looks nice.

GE lost me as a customer for life after this."	0

53794	I hate my Fisher & Paykel Smartload dryer!  Even when brand new it always took about 1.5 hours to dry a load of laundry coming out of my equally inefficient and unreliable Fisher & Paykel EcoSmart washer.  The dryer has quit heating several times now over the past three years  Most recently, when it quit heating it took two service calls to 'repair' it.  Then one week later it quit heating again.  We use the machine rather lightly, doing laundry for only two people, so it is not a machine that has been heavily used at all since we bought it almost five years ago.  I will never buy another FP appliance again.	0

41153	Very disappointing purchase. After trying generic filters that either flooded my house or had no flow, I thought paying the extra money for the pricey Samsung model would do the trick. Not! This filter produced ZERO drinking water. After reading the reviews it appears that some of these may be knock-offs and not genuine manufacturer's parts. The packaging matched the photo on the Samsung website, but how do you know? The seller did not respond to emails.	0

If you get a W10884390 without a new wiring harness (which many listing photos seem to indicate), you cannot use it with the older wiring harness that came with a model W10469286 (as pin configurations between icemaker and harness are different).  Product installed and works fine (since it came with a new wiring harness), but sales listing should clearly state which model you are actually getting.	1

34610	"The handle portion is so small that it doesn't cover the opening in my dryer.  The materials are flimsy and cracked at every turn.  I could live with those things considering this was an inexpensive item for an old dryer.  But the real problem is that the plastic of the main section was too thick.  Yes, thick is good for stability but it was thicker than my old one and nothing I possibly did could get it into the dryer.  I tried for a good half hour.  Other than the handle and the thickness of the plastic, the trap was identical to my old (broken) trap.

The only good news is that Amazon gave me a full refund and free shipping to send it back.  I don't mind paying more for one that will work but I'm afraid to try now.  In theory these things are all supposed to be the same.  I guess my only recourse is the brand-name replacement, which is close to $50."	0

3303	Huge tub - I can wash two large moving blankets with ease and they come out very clean.  Self-Balancing!  This means you don't have to lie on the floor with a wrench and clumsily attempt to perfectly adjust all four feet on an unven floor - just set it in place and the feet self adjust and stabilize the washer during spin and wash cycles.  It won't shake your house down like most washers during spin cycle.  My laundry room is on the third floor of my house and my LG front loader would make it feel like an earthquake; oh and the LG shook the house less than the previous top loader GE.  I practically gave away a matched set of LG front load washer and dryer that were less than two years old.  I paid $2500 for the top of the line front loaders and what junk!  Two hours later my clothes were still soggy and had soap residue and I tried everything the vendor recommended to get soap-free dry clothes.  This Speed Queen will put a big smile on your face if you too are getting rid of the new, fancy, computer controlled, light dazzling, door locking, dry sensing, and wash crappy front loaders.	1

32063	"A nice looking range with many good features - BUT... I would not buy it again.

When using the oven, heat comes out of the oven vent located at the right rear of the oven top and at high oven settings (400 degrees) the air is so hot you can't touch the control panel without burning yourself.  The bottom of our adjacent cabinets were extremely hot also.  According to the service rep, this is not a malfunction - it is just the way it works!  Safety/recall issue!

The grate on the top of the stove is nice to look at, but not FLAT!  The two little tangs in the center of each burner are higher than the rest of the grate top.  As a result, pans ""wobble"" on the cook top when stirring.  A replacement grate has an identical problem.  Design issue!

Be careful when reaching into cabinets above the stove.  It's very easy to brush against the knobs on the front and accidentally turn on a burner!  Ask me how I know!"	0

4704	"First, I have owned Whirlpool appliances for many years and have had great service with them. This is why when my old dishwasher defaulted, I decided on Whirlpool.

Pros:

1) Cleans the dishes quite well. I use regular Cascade powder with lemon and Jet Dry.
**I tried some of the power gels, but prefer regular powder.

2) Quiet - My kitchen is close to my living room and when I watch TV, I cannot hear the dishwasher at all.

3) One Hour Wash - To use this (and it cleans perfectly), I go to  - One Hour Wash and then press start/resume. And in one hour, my dishes come out sparkly clean.

4) Basic model that has TWO RINSE ARMS. And not too many bells and whistles. This is a BUDGET MID RANGE MODEL, not a top of the line, but worth the price.

**True stars: 4.9

2062	I wanted these to work, I really did.  They did indeed fit perfectly into my Samsung refrigerator, and I was very excited because of all the positive reviews.  Also, note that I did reset my filter by holding the button down until it beeped.  They work great for about a month.  The problem is that they are supposed to be good for 6 months or 300 gallons.  Not so much.  After about a month (and maybe 50 gallons) the flow through the filter had slowed to a trickle that would literally take several minutes to fill an 8 oz glass.  But it's a 3-pack, right?  So I replaced the first one thinking maybe I just got a bad one.  Same thing with the second one.  It's been about 3 weeks and the family is getting water out of the tap because nobody has time to stand there for 5 minutes to fill up their glass.  Going to replace it again soon, but at 3-4 weeks per filter these get really expensive, not to mention wasteful.  I guess I'll be going back to Samsung filters...	0

I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out."	1

42952	"We bought a Whirlpool Duet Washer in 2002 and it did work well for nine years.  When it broke I researched the problem and determined that the outer tub needed to be replaced.  That part alone costs over $400 on the internet and requires complete disassembly of the machine.  I called the Whirlpool Service number on the front of our manual to see what it might cost to have the repair work done.  I explained the situation to Brandy, who told me that our machine qualified for a program that, for a flat fee of $325.91, would pay 100% of the cost of Labor and Materials to repair the machine, no matter what was wrong with it. I was skeptical and reiterated that the cost of parts alone would probably be $500 or more.  She insisted that this program would cover all costs of repair and would include a one year warranty.  She said she could set up a repair appointment as soon as I paid the $325.91.  I just figured that Whirlpool was trying to reestablish some good will for current customers after reading so many negative reviews online about them.  I paid w/a credit card and she scheduled an appointment for two days later w/a local repair company.

The service guy showed up and spent 5 - 10 minutes looking at the washer and determined that the outer tub did indeed need to be replaced but that he needed authorization to order the parts and do the repairs.  He also said that, in this situation, the company usually just offered a cash settlement according to a formula in the contract based on the age of the appliance.  This, of course, was not what I had agreed to so I called the Company that was administering the contract and spoke to Natalie.  I explained the situation and she did a little research and said that we had a ""Broken Appliance Contract"" and that, yes, the contract would pay 100% of the cost of repairs, extend the warranty one year, and, if the service guy couldn't fix the washer, would pay to replace it with a comparable machine.  She also said that she spoke to Edwin at the Repair Company and that he had already ordered the parts and would be calling me to schedule the actual repair.

Two days later we get a call from the Company administering the contract and Rose said she could offer us $202.50 instead of doing the repairs because it wouldn't be cost effective for them. I demurred and asked for a supervisor.  Antoine got on the line and apologised that I might have been misinformed about the terms of the contract but I explained to him that two different people from two different companies (Whirlpool and the Contract Administration Co.) had misrepresented the terms of the contract in exactly the same way and that they were perpetrating an organized fraud.  I demanded my money back or that they repair the washer according to the verbal contract I had with Whirlpool.  He agreed to reimburse me $299 which he said was the cost of the contract and wouldn't do more than that.

I called Whirlpool and spoke to a supervisor and insisted that they reimburse the balance of $325.91 and registered a complaint about the fraud that they were running.

They promised reimbursement checks in 7 to 10 days.  If we don't receive them, they'll have to deal with American Express.

Whirlpool is running a blatant bait and switch fraud and I will never buy another Whirlpool or Maytag product again."	0

27036	This is the cheapest piece of crap I have ever bought. I replaced this same part less than two years ago and it broke again this morning. I actually decided not to order it this time and used duct tape to repair it which seems to be working for now. I refuse to pay $23 for a piece of plastic that probably costs $2 to manufacture. I have been buying Kenmore refrigerators for over 30 years and with every new model they try to cut a few more corners (no freezer light, way thinner plastic bins, shelves that don't extend out to the guard rail so whatever you put on them tips over,  etc), greedy bastards. I guess next time I buy a refrigerator I'll try a different brand.	0
30871	"Make sure you save the box the filter came in so you can send it back when you taste the water!

After ordering an off-brand filter (I didn't realize it was a knock off until I received it), I had to send it back.  The tabs on the installation end broke off when I tried to put the little end-cap on.

Now I'm wondering what to try.  This Whirlpool Brand filter was ordered because it was Whirlpool.  Has to be better because it's Whirlpool, right???

But no.  As others have said, this filter leaves the water completely non-palatable.  Have tried to run multiple courses of water through, and nothing improves the taste.  And of course I tossed the box before I actually tasted the water, so I feel like I'm stuck."	0

3442	"Don't buy Whirlpool's new coupler Part #285753A with the steel insert!

Use this coupler and not the newer version Part # 285753A.  This latest version coupler has steel inserts imbedded in its 2 plastic sections, the idea
being to make it more reliable. I'm afraid this hasn't been the case in practice, so
avoid this one.

I have two reasons for this. First, they are so tight and hard to drive onto the gearcase
and motor shafts, it's hard to install one without damaging the shafts. And because they
are so tight, removal when they do break can also be very difficult.

Secondly, repairmen have started to see them stripping/rounding off the drive flats on motor
shafts, ruining motors - and that's unacceptable! The idea behind any drive 'weak link'
- belt, coupler, etc - is to slip or sacrificially fail when something goes horribly wrong,
to keep from ruining something more major and expensive.

Having to replace an expensive main drive motor due to a $10 drive coupler failure
tells us there's a major problem with this new coupler design with the metal insert.  Continue to use Part #285753 which Amazon sells for a few cents more."	1

8412	"After the ice maker in our 25 year old fridge died and couldn't be repaired we began to buy several bags of ice a week. When we saw this ice maker on sale we decided to take a chance. We're glad we did.
It makes ice very quickly (about a dozen cubes every 10 minutes) and runs quietly. Our only challenge was finding a place to put it. Because it's slightly taller than the space under our cabinets we were disappointed not to be able to put it on the counter near the sink where we could fill the water reservoir using our faucet sprayer. However, because the ventilation is on the side and back, we decided to take the 1"" feet off the bottom (just unscrew them) and now it fits on the counter. So far it runs very well and we use it nearly every day to keep the ice holder in our freezer full of ice."	1

17331	"Motor maybe great.... Time will tell.  But read the following and tell me what you think.
In mid April, I bought the Minn Kota Riptide Ulterra 80/IP w/i-Pilot 24V-80lb-54"" via AMAZON from Offshore Wake for nearly $200 more than what they currently are advertising them for (which is $1999.99).  The motor arrived a few days later and I had it professionally installed on a MinnKota RTA 17 Riptide Composite Quick Release Bracket with a special 24 volt plug/receptacle costing $50 (as recommended)
From the very start, this motor gave us problems in that it would not fully stow away onto the holding bracket. After several tries, calling Minn Kota head quarters, taking the motor apart per their instructions, and spending hours on the phone, nothing resolved the problem.  Finally the motor decided not to work at all (did not deploy or stow) and would only display a red flashing status light.

Per Minn Kotas request, I took the motor to a registered dealer in Deland (hour drive).  He had it for a few days talking to Minn Kota head quarters, but was also unsuccessful.  By now Offshore Wake started to get involved after the poor review I gave and requested return of my money.  Otherwise I wanted the motor replaced immediately. Minn Kota refused to send a new motor until they had the broken one in hand. So the dealer in Deland boxed it up for me with Quick Release Bracket and special plug still attached.  We sent it back along with a note that I wanted a new motor with the current Quick Release Bracket and special plug transferred to this new motor.  Test it out to be sure nothing is wrong.
Needless to say, the new motor came, but neither the Quick Release Bracket nor special plug was attached.  The Quick Release Bracket came in a separate box, but still no plug.  So once again I had to take it down to a professional dealer and have a the Quick Release Bracket and new plug installed (at a cost of $100).
Minn Kota needs to know that this chain of events which cost me three weeks of BS time instead of fishing, is unsatisfactory.  I am one disappointed customer.

One month after I originally bought this motor I finally have a motor that works. However, she still has not been water tested as will do that tomorrow.  It cost me an additional $100 to get new motor professionally installed which included another special plug.  Add to that, the extra $200 I paid for this item and inconvenience I went through, some type of compensation should be awarded to me.
Whats only fair to me is that Minn Kota offers me a Plus 2 Extended Warranty for free.
This is a $290 value that will provide the compensation I deserve at no cost to Minn Kota if their motors work as well as they say they do.
Why should I pay for this with all the inconvenience and additional cost I went through

I deserve a four year guarantee

I am requesting Minn Kota and/or Offshore Wake to please respond to this request at their earliest convenience.  Please provide me someone to contact to get this compensation resolved.

30803	Instant water leak	0
7724	I don't know what happened but the filter quickly turned rust color (as you can see in the photo) and was turning our drinking water yellow/orange.  It also made our water taste quite disgusting as you can imagine.  Ordered a genuine Frigidaire filter in a hurry and now all is better.  I would not recommend buying one of these off-brand filters.  Yikes!	0

7616	I purchased this item in August or so and the cold water hose failed, on the curved end at the crimped on fitting, by the following February. It's been to long to return or replace. I would not recommend buying this product.	0
1638	"It took about 10 minutes to remove the defective ice maker from my freezer and install this one.  Easy install, everything lined up. Within 2 /12 hours I heard the first batch of land in the bin..

I had to re-use the cable from the old one as this ones shipped with this unit were not long enough."	1
4893	Perfect fit	1
4919	They do the job as best they can.... it is a small humidifier so you can't expect it to put out the moisture like a large wick filter/humidifier does.  The filters hold up... and go the distance/time. :)	1
44406	I've used rack paint before but this stuff has peeled off.  I'm buying a different brand.  After getting what I can of this stuff off, I hope the next brand I buy will stick.  No, I didn't use the dishwasher until it had plenty of time to dry and cure.	0

54494	Suspect that this may be a counterfeit.  Mechanical dimensions are same as old part but materials are clearly very cheap.  Doesn't lock how it is supposed to.  Can twist backwards with minimal pressure.  Returned shortly after opening/inspecting.  Would never hold up in the washer.	0

3212	I've been buying the Jenn Air brand of filter and they are pricey. I went out on a limb and got these based on the reviews. I wasn't disappointed! Just about 3 filters for the price of 1!	1
8465	Not good, it creates moisture in the room and the dryer has gone wrong with no hot air at all after a while, don't know whether it is caused by this.  At last, I need to replace the dryer.	0
40918	"Whirlpool intentionally includes two defects in this part:  1) plastic and 2) square hole.  The fan must be removed in order to replace the motor, but nearly always is stuck to the motor shaft such that the square hole deforms under the pressure to remove the fan.

I put it on slightly loose, and now the fan squeaks.  I fear tightening it more because I don't want to damage the square hole.

Whirlpool could have extended the metal shaft in a way you could torque the metal shaft with a metal tool, but the metal tool on plastic leads to a deformed hole and breaking the fan out until the metal mount is exposed."	0

55659	We loved this icemaker for the 1.5 months it worked for. It just stopped. Now it just beeps. We unplugged went over instructions and tried to begin fresh. No ice just beeping and looks like no way to return. Honestly one week earlier I would have given it 5 stars. I'm so sad.	0

51873	I have never had more problems with a machine than this one. It doesn't like to wash blankets and towels. It will drain but not spin the water out. I have to take the towels and ring them out. also does not like pillows. The lid locks during washing but some times it won't unlock when it's done.  Some times it won't unlock for several days leaving my clothes to start mildewing. It's really frustrating. I have a family of 6 and I have to do laundry every day. We have tried to turn off the power to unlock it but hasn't worked. I'll come back the third day and it decided to unlock itself!!!	0

5218	"This product was bundled together with An ultrasonic humidifier I purchased at the same time as a ""frequently bought together"" add-on item.
The print is so small on the back of the bottle it is very hard to even read. So I put it in my ultrasonic humidifier in my bedroom and it made me cough so much I had to turn it off. Thought I was going to die, I could not hardly breather and had to leave the room for hours. Next morning I get my magnifying glass and read that this product is TOXIC to humans and domestic animals!

37808	"We purchased this instant dishwasher stainless film as a relatively inexpensive (shipping was pricey but I needed it quickly) option to update our dishwasher, the last remaining appliance, before listing our condo For Sale.

This product applied relatively easy. Take time to read instructions and go slow in order to avoid air bubbles. It is a good product but the finish wasn't a good match for us. Our dishwasher is white, matches the cabinets, and sits next to the SS stove and using this film was far cheaper than upgrading.

In the end, it was better to leave the dishwasher as-is rather than covered with the film, which made it stand out even more. Incidentally, the product was fairly easy to remove. I will attempt to use the remaining roll for a home craft project."	0
44537	I have no issue with the exhaust pull, since I have thec1200cfm fan pulling through a 10 inch duct. My problem is that the motor to raise the unit when turned on is too weak to raise the unit. Called service out, he called factory, they said it must not be straight and is binding. We removed the cooktop and made sure the vent was free floating and it still does not work. It will work if I take the filters out, they are quite heavy. Clearly the motor is too weak, but company will not stand behind it. DO NOT BUY CHEAPLY MADE EXPENSIVE PRODUCT	0

15446	Buyer BEWARE! There is the older PLASTIC based knob (Sears Kenmore 80, etc.) that is identical in all respects except the PLASTIC (easily broken) threaded connection area AND NOTE: The thread size on the older plastic models and the (newer) metal models IS DIFFERENT.  This knob CANNOT replace the older plastic model(s).  Other than that, this is a FINE knob.	0

9315	After a little bit of research, I discovered the P/N of my old board for my Kenmore Elite Refrigerator.  This model has the same part number.  However, when I received this board, I noticed that one particular connection was missing between my old and new.  I am no electrician but found that this connection was either for the Temperature shut off...or for just the freezer light.  (I am having refrigerator issues, and this board is not the only issue.)  So, after I installed this board, I saw no improvement of my refrigerator, and after the repair man came, refilled my coolant, and left, my refrigerator turned into a full-size freezer.  My water lines broke and caused even more problems.  So I placed the original board back in, the fridge warmed up, Put the new board back in and after a couple of days of frozen pickles...now the refrigerator is acting normal (ish?) with the new board.  So, make sure you do your research, trouble shooting and ensure that the items you order match what you need exactly.  I still don't know if this new board is a problem or a solution.  (Don't buy Kenmore...LG rebrand.)	1

9051	"I am so glad that I purchased this. I have a front load washing machine. Small loads are impossible to do. They are also expensive to dry in a large electric dryer. I took away one star for the handle.. my daughter was able to crack it quite easily. I had already decided that was not going to be our regular way of using it--we just rotate the thing ourselves. My hubby had it together in less than five minutes. It takes very little soap--and does exactly as it promises. I was surprised at how well it did on cheese and BBQ sauce stains as well. It is so much easier on underclothing than the washer. i bought an accordion style drying rack as well. With everything going up in price it just make sense to do smaller loads in this and hang them to dry. I love it.. and so does my seven year old daughter-she actually does most of the work.

I do wish it wasn't plastic-especially when I have to use bleach. I won't take away from the review on that point as I knew it was plastic when we purchased it.

The stand is a bit flimsy.. but my hubby can make us a wooden one if this one happens to break. All in all, I am very pleased w/ my purchase. Great idea! :)"	1

And again someone else stated that they purchased two sets (for a total of 4).  NO!!!!!! When I purchased 2 I received only 2 at $10.59 each plus shipping (not 4 like I expected).  Now they are $14.76 each for 1.  Give me a break these are not worth the price!!!	0
45338	One of the worst washer we ever brought! We had high hope in this washer considering we brought it for over $700. We had it for two years and had to call our for service every two months due to small particles getting stuck or water doesn't drain. We had to buy warranty so it wouldn't cost us an arm and leg every time they come out to fix the washer. It torn our clothes and sounds like a freight train! We thought it was our fault because it keeps messing up but clearly we are not the only one. Needless to said glad the washer is discontinued and we will not buy another Maytag appliances! Will definitely throw this piece of garbage away.	0
11141	I purchased this washer 14 months ago from Lowes. 600 bucks. 2 months after warranty expires it stops working.  Repair estimate is $411.00!  Main electronic board malfunctioning.  Called Whirlpool to try to get part under warranty.  Not a chance.  They outright refused to even consider this.  2 months past warranty and this P.O.S. needs $400+ in service.  Screw you Whirlpool.  Never again.  Lost customer for life. Avoid or buy extended warranty from store.  (Do not buy extended warranty from Whirlpool, they wanted $300+ for 3 year warranty!)	0
18647	I decided to try these after only using the brand name options because of the cost.  They worked great, no plastic taste like some of the reviews state, but after only a few weeks, my water started tasting like it does out of the tap.  We have horrible tasting water, so its easy to tell when the filter is done.  Our ice and water start tasting like crap.  The brand name filters gave me a good 3 months of solid use but were 3x the cost.  So I think I'll go back to the brand name ones.	0
3424	Installed in the eveniing and had a bucket of ice in the a.m.  Easy installation!  My wife was very happy with the price and the results.	1

7860	Time for a new fridge!  Thank goodness for the extended warranty ...4 1/2 yrs later......  1st time the fridge broke and had to replace $200.00 worth of food.  2nd time the ice maker had to be replaced.  3rd time the repairman broke the ice maker trying to fix it.  4th time the poor guy ordered a new door.  5th time the new door did not fit and we finally got $815.32 to put to a new fridge.  And in all that time the ice would drip out and melt and run down the front of the fridge making it just plain ugly.  I hate this fridge.  Not even garage worthy. Wish us luck!  Our Samsung is going to be delivered tomorrow.	0

24407	Did not work. It broke right away. They would not replace or return my money after several attempts to try and get a hold of them. The company was very rude. Would not ever recommend to anyone.	0
7204	Zero stars for the product; 2 stars for the customer service. The refrigerator worked for 9 months and then quit.  After a lot of back and forth with Danby customer service, a new one showed up on our porch 3 months after the first one quit.  The second one lasted 3 weeks before it leaked a lot of a clear chemical fluid and stopped working.  Danby sent us a check for most of the purchase price.  We now have 2 useless refrigerators in our garage that will cost $38 each to be hauled away by the People's Republic of Seattle.	0
1327	My line broke on my OEM part. I installed the new wheels and they were so loud that I could not use them. My wife could not believe that they could sound that bad! Luckily my original wheels were fine so I used the new line with my old wheels and it works great. I would only buy this set if you need the line. No idea how the wheels could be so loud!	0

452	"We bought the cheapest fridge that fit in our kitchen, which happened to be the fridge that was counter depth (read: not at all cheap) and I wanted the water dispenser so we just chose the Sears fridge that had that option. I had no idea it also had the world's most expensive water filter. This version is the one that works on the Sears fridge, but costs about half the price I'd have to pay at Sears. It works. The water and ice taste fine. My only complaint is that the fridge reminds us to replace the filter every 6 months, regardless of usage. I think it's a bit of a scam in that regard, so we hit the reset button and just order new ones when we can taste that we need a new one.

In terms of value, buy here instead of Sears. In terms of quality, it works very well to filter the water and make it better tasting."	1
7619	Can not wash more than a few small items.	0

7246	"I had this beverage center for 3 years. It was fairly inexpensive, as it appears to still be here on Amazon, so the 3 years doesn't really bother me too much, but it still bothers me.

It looks good, has the cool blue LED light, but for a compressor cooled unit, it leaves something to be desired. The temperature of liquids should be a little more refreshing when consumed, so I couldn't recommend this for ""ice cold"" beer; just slightly refreshing water and soda. I would buy a replacement one as long as the price was good, but this time I would look to experiment on my old one to figure how to rig the thermostat so it could get cool enough to make it revitalizing.

I also have another smaller Haier that works fine also (compressor unit too) but it will build up ice on the exchange unit, something that this model never did."	1
54723	"THESE ARE WORTHLESS. The second one I used ended up splitting along the bottom after I pulled it out of the compactor, spilling garbage all over my kitchen floor. They are also difficult to put into the bin, since the ""pre-folded overhang"" is cut in an odd way and has a tendency to get caught when closing the compactor. Do yourself a favor and purchase good, high-quality plastic compactor bags."	0

I could bypass this thing and plug the disposer directly into the wall and it never flipped off, but every time I reattached this unit, it would throw the reset button on the bottom of the disposer after 2-3 times.  I was able to return it for full credit (got in just under the 30 day limit!)	0

52778	"I purchased a showcase home and was impressed with the Bosch kitchen appliance package that was included with my new home.  Within two weeks of using the stove, our teapot melted on the stove when accidentally left unattended.  OK, this was our bad and no fault of Bosch, but we were surprised how powerful this stove is that it could melt a teapot!  Several months later we noticed the two large front burners started to get discolored and cannot be scoured, cleaned or scrapped with a razor blade to return it to it's original finish.  We have lived with a white char marks on the stove ever since. Earlier this week while sliding a plate off the top of a frying pan on the stove (we did not have a lid large enough) , it was accidentally dropped on the glass surface which chipped the edge of the glass on the stove, but the plate did not break.  Since this incidence, the chip has turn into a crack that has run the entire length of the stove.

We have a 2nd residence which we purchased a Samsung glass top slide in stove for.  We have not had any issues with the glass discoloring, chipping, cracking or overheating of the elements.  I don't normally write reviews for products, but the $600.00 price tag to replace this stove top was my motivation.  Far better choices out there than this stove, do your research and stay away from Bosch."	0

12386	"When we replaced an earlier model with this one we began to experience intermittent problems with the spin cycle. This left our clothes soaking wet. Called Samsung customer service and their representatives could not have been less helpful. My wife and I spent hours on the phone with their representatives who read from a script of responses. I even took a day off from work to run through their ""phone diagnostics"". This amounted to cleaning the front drain and repositioning the hose. While this did nothing (no obstruction or even slime as the unit is only three months old) the representative told me that because the machine had completed it's cycle after ""this fix"" they were not responsible. I repeated that the problem had been and still is intermittent. Out came the script of responses. The representative even offered to send me the script or handbook for dealing with customer problems. I felt they were making me  responsibility for diagnosing the problem and they repeatedly told me if a repair person was sent out and the problem did not occur I would have to pay the bill. I asked to speak to a Supervisor and after 10 minutes on hold she finally picked up the call and repeated the same script of responses. I am left with a machine that works sometimes and sometimes does not.

Samsung clearly does not stand behind their products and calling customer support has been an epic frustration. I will never buy another product from Samsung because if it does not work they don't stand behind their products. We have wasted countless hours over the past week and the only thing that has changed is my blood pressure.  .RWS"	0

22738	Awful product.  The chip in the filter does not sink up with my fridge and does not work.  It continues to show filter needs replacing and shuts off water to fridge and icemaker.  Do not buy this filter or the RPWFE required fridges of GE.  The fridge is only 2 months old and the water filter replacement came on and no override is available on the fridge.  Tried 2 of these filters and one from Lowes (RPWFE) that are required in the new GE fridges (to communicate with fridge) and they do not work!	0

19037	I like the product, it makes ice pretty quick. It doesn't hold the ice for very long before it starts melting though. I think since it was Igloo branded, I expected more.	0
8878	I absolutely love this machine. I wish I couldve got a bigger model. Hooks ups to my washer hook ups perfectly.	1
2701	It is a switch. It turns the disposal on and it turns the disposal off. It performs its single function appropriately.	1
56996	"Steer very clear of this machine, lots of bad reviews varying from different levels of poor support, I didn't get LG because I had a really bad experience with their phone and a TV, and have had good luck with Samsung monitors and phones. So when given the opportunity I picked Samsung over LG even thought the LG looked like it was a better machine.

Anyway, besides the Best Buy guys (yes I ordered it from there mistakenly) breaking the washer in two minor places, the knob is cracked and the trap door in the front won't close (they were nice enough to tape it up instead of telling me about it), the washing machine does not use enough water. Regardless how much soap you use, it is almost like it never really touches the garments. The cycle, if you watch it, seems to barely get any water at all. Clothes still smell like BO and in my sons case, like he took his clothes from wetting the bed and dampened them just enough to get wet, rung them out, and dried them. Which is pretty much all this machine seems to do.

The kicker? The machine takes forever. Average is an hour and a half, but the 3 hour cycle is what we have been forced to use, and still, the clothes do not get clean, they look clean, but the smell like they have maybe been worn have the time they were actually worn.

As for the dryer, make sure you put everything on high. The sensor does not work well. Sucks when it doesnt need it, but it is really hard to tell what does need what time, thats what the sensor is supposed to be for. Otherwise it works pretty well and we are relatively happy with it."	0
21782	This product was purchased on Sept. 14th 2015 and it broke EXACTLY one year to the date of purchase. Keep in mind we used it in our office everyday for one year....but when you buy an appliance you expect it to last longer than one year. Calling an appliance company would be too much of an investment to get it repaired. I'm online shopping another ice maker but it will NOT be this one.	0
36564	"Looking back, I probably got my money's worth by not having to buy bagged ice, but there have to be better constructed ice makers on the market. I'm still looking.
The sensor malfunctioned, so it didn't shut off when the basket was full. This caused the shovel arm to crack and now it doesn't work at all. Really cheap materials."	0

41186	This works fine as a magnifying lamp with a place to store your hot soldering iron, but the arm extension came missing a piece to attach it.  I could have returned it for a replacement, but didn't want to.  The light is ok, but not the greatest but that is because it is only operated on a battery.  Not a bad product if all the pieces were included.	0
6841	I haven't noticed any leaking and the water tastes fine.  My parents haven't replaced the old filter for YEARS because the price was too high, so I hope this works out.  It was really easy to install, too.	1
15195	I am giving this freezer two stars for the following reasons: I received the freezer on June 16, 2016. When I opened the carton, I noticed that It was dented.  I discovered that It stopped working when on, May 16, 2017, I opened the lid and found spoiled food. This is not a good investment. The actual cost of the freezer is $18.20 per month during its 11 month life span.	0
4527	All was good.	1
18869	OK product. Hard to get completely full of water without it running out. Must be kept level.  Most of the time the cubes have overflow and you have to chip off excess to make it look somewhat round.  Have it, would not purchase another.  But OK for party conversation.	0

13924	These knobs are the cheapest plastic on the market. They melt and break on a regular basis.  The entire Jenn-Air cooktop is poorly designed.  When cooking, the pans sit too close to the knobs, and the heat is more than they can withstand.  The knobs started melting within the first 2 weeks of using the cooktop.  My builder installed this cooktop and I thought it was going to be a really good one.  Instead I am saving my money to replace the entire thing.	0
41517	The door on my old dispenser would not stay on so I got this replacement part.  This one just dumps the whole reservoir of rinse aid as soon as you close dishwasher door.  Soap dispenser latch extremely flimsy.  Hard to believe it's legal for manufacturers to sell such poorly made items.  Ever heard of QC/QA?  I've gotten a lot more sophisticated parts for a lot less money than this.	0

7705	Haha it came quickly and worked fine, but my F/H error was caused by my not opening the valves far enough at the hookups. After many years the deposits built up and nearly completely closed the narrow path. After replacing the flow meter and running the diagnostics I still got the F/H, then I checked the valves and opened them fully. Silly me.	1

7769	"Ice spheres are an awesome way to cool down a beverage.  They don't melt quickly like small ice cubes, but with a huge surface area on the outside, they cool the drink fast.  So you get a great cooling effect in your beverage without it watering down.  They are fun to put into everything.  We're not big drinkers, but my kids even loved having them in their water just for the fun of it (and yes, I realize you can't water down water).

This set makes the sphere freezing process simple.  You fill the plastic cup at the bottom to the fill line, put the silicon top over it, and put it in the freezer.  The convenient fill line ensures you don't overfill the sphere which can be a big problem with other moulds when you overfill them and it freezes into a weird blobby shape.  I got perfect ice spheres every time.  The ice can be a bit of a problem to release at the end, but a small run under warm water made it come right out.

Recommended tool for making perfect ice spheres.

Note: I received a free sample for review."	1

17848	"This filter is NOT worth the price asked. I ordered a replacement, and after installing it I dissected the original filter that came with our fridge. The attached images show how the filter is constructed. It is a simple activated charcoal cylinder with some very basic o-ring sealing, worth probably around $10 max. I estimate that about 65-85% of the cost of the filter is just profit.

Many companies play the same kind of pricing games for ongoing items, but I think it's deceptive, dishonest, and creates poor incentives for properly maintaining the appliance (which they probably want so they don't have to honor warranty claims). I despise these kinds of business practices, and refuse to cooperate.

Additionally, the 6 month replacement period is ridiculous unless your water supply is exceptionally contaminated. We are on well water and the only thing which needs to be removed is sediment (which is taken care of by a different filter system). The filter I dissected was used for 22 months, and based on what I found within I will now only be replacing the filter every 5 years or so.

Maybe others are happy to pay out the nose for very basic filtration, but I am not."	0

383	Great bargain. Buy the Authentic Samsung Water Filter. Don't skimp and get the faux. The Authentic one here on Amazon, especially the multipacks are cheaper than at Best Buy or other local retailer - I have purchased several times without any problems. I will note. Our first time to change on our new Samsung side by side, we couldn't get the old filter out. No matter how hard we tried. Called the Samsung hotline. User error. LOL! We did not know we had to cut the water source off (ours was int he garage we discovered ) and like magic, the old one came out and we were able to easily put the new one in. Live and learn!	1
4231	My Elite dishwasher was making a grinding noise and I googled this to see what may be causing it.  After a few other trial and error fixes, I narrowed the problem to the pump and motor assembly.  This one arrived quickly, was very easy to install, and now my dishwasher functions as new.  this is basically the entire mechanical heart of the unit - when it is replaced, you don't have much left that can go wrong with your unit.	1
4434	"My 8 year-old dryer started squealing, so I determined that one or more rollers needed replacement.  However, the Sears Parts Direct website indicated that this kit was not a replacement part for my Sears Kenmore Elite HE4 Model # 110.95088402 dryer.  But the rollers looked identical to the $12 ea. Parts Direct ""approved"" rollers.  So I took the $20 gamble and couldn't be more pleased, the four rollers, belt and tension roller all fit perfectly, the dryer works like new and the Mrs. is happy.  My only recommendation is to re-use the old triangle retention clips if possible instead of the ones in the kit, they seem much sturdier and thicker, just be gentle when removing them."	1
38991	This filter is supposed to replace the GE GSWF. Perhaps I got a bad one, but it did not work in my refrigerator. No matter how I tried to adjust or re-seat it, it leaked water every day. Rather than saving money by buying this, I ended up tossing this and paying for a genuine GE filter. I almost always stay away from name brands if I can help it. This is one of those rare products where I will only ever buy the GE replacement ever again.	0
44821	"After three years of owning my GE stove I am still not a Fan!  In the first few months of ownership I had service out at least three times. The burners were on high or low not much of a range in between and isn't that what we have gas for. They are better but still not great.  Then the ""lower oven"". I really bought it over others because of the lower over, I was asured it would cook pizza, ya in two days! Then it seemed we were not around for some time and before you know it the warranty is up.

I am not a ""super cook"" but I use it like three times a week. I always loved my old oven on convect and when for the 5th time dinner took 40 min. too long I got a thermomator and sure enough 50 to 75 degrees low. It looks cute though, thank God, but really way too much money for what I got, looks like others are feeling the same.

I haven't melted my knobs yet, but I'm sure I will.  I shake my head every time I wash the knobs at how flacky they seem for a $2400 stove. I haven't turned ""clean"" on yet either...probably won't get hot enough!"	0

21183	"So I posted this when I bought it: ""One of the best tech purchases I've ever made""
Now, three months later: It has stopped working. It does not move from cycle to cycle, just does one cycle continuously without stopping. For example, when it starts washing it is stuck in ""wash"" cycle. If you stop it, and manually select ""spin"" cycle it will do spin cycle and never stop doing it, even if the machine is already empty. Very disappointing, I was so happy with it for three months!"	0
6313	This product is not exactly as good as what I had in my dryer originally so I'm thinking it's the cheap version.  Don't get me wrong, it works but don't let any lint build up or you won't be able to get the darned screen out; take it out and clean after each drying session!!!	1
1446	"Bought two of these to replace the stock filter in our LG fridge.  The fit and finish was perfect, installation was just as easy as the original LG filter and the quality of the water is excellent.  I did notice that the water flow is a little higher with this filter installed, but otherwise, is undetectable from the original (which is a good thing).

Always remember when installing a new water filter to discard at least a gallon of water before drinking it.  There will be air in the line with a new filter so be prepared for some sputtering at first, but after the first gallon, it should go away."	1
5119	If, I had no other options for washing, I'd be happy to have this. I like the idea of the eco-egg more than actually using it. It works well, as described in the many videos available on youtube.	1

56236	After reading all the reviews and help from everybody and thank you by the way, these filters would not go in. There's something in the manufacturing of this filter that catches before it gets to the lock position, thus making it impossible to lock the filter in place. Compared to the old filter, a great difference. The old one goes in with small resistance and locks, but the new one will not lock into place.	0

16380	"I ordered this specific item from Amazon, with Amazon fulfillment, by regular shipping.  It arrived in 5 days so I have no problem with shipping.  Unfortunately the new springs did not fix the Unbalanced Load problem on Spin cycle on the Kenmore Oasis.  Using my hand to wobble the tub, there seemed to be extremely excessive side to side movement possible with the original (worn ?) springs. After I replaced the springs, cups and bases with this new set there seemed to be absolutely no difference in the possible movement; the tub still easily hits the sides when moved by hand.  The new springs seemed to provide the same strength/tension as the original set.  I experienced the same results in tub wobble both before and after the ""repair"". The washer works fine until it reaches the Spin cycle where it stops and then tries to refill itself while displaying a UL code.  I will not put any more time or money into what seems to be a washer with a suspension problem.  I will buy a cheap basic washer and scrap the fancy sophisticated one."	0
10407	If the water runs out during the day, and you aren't there to fill it, the filters dry out and will never wick up the water again.  Filters only last a couple weeks and even less if they dry out while you are at work.  Not a good value.  Hope someone markets a filter that can survive a few hours without water.	0
53523	I had to use the rubber gasket from the old filter to keep this filter from leaking. Where the filter connects to the refrigerator has changed slightly and is not the same as previous filters of the same brand. While I was able to use the filter, I won't be purchasing this brand again.	0

This is a danger issue and the company insists on attempting a repair - again.  I am requesting my money returned and they have stopped conversation via email. If you are given the choice stay far away from this product.

6/17/16- This range and Thor kitchen and I have had a very rocky relationship.  I will give status as of today: The new range has been installed and after many calls, emails and screaming fits I believe I have a working piece of equipment.  Thor Kitchen seems to be a young company and as such they are experiencing many growing pains.  One of those is how to handle faulty equipment once in a customers home.  I lived with a faulty piece of equipment for 8 months before they agreed to replace it.  I believe in the future they will be quicker to make the customer happy.

If you have issues with your burners, please contact the company directly in Chino California, the warranty people are absolutely useless.  I hope that the company has a better run in the future.

UPDATE:
I purchased this stove in September and had it installed in October of 2015- the broiler did not work at time of delivery- a week later repairman #1 came out- fixed broiler.
2 weeks later the ignitor would not stop continually clicking repairman #2 came out, problem continued repairman #3.  Problem continued repairman #4, after repairman #4 came out the oven stopped working.  This happened to be over the Thanksgiving holiday so I had no way to prepare my family a holiday meal.  Repairman #5 came out and parts for ignitor were sent.  The issue with the ignitor continued, repairman #6 and a new set of parts.  Along the way the oven stopped working again and after my 5th or 6th call the head office in California said they would send another repairman.  This would be repairman 7 or 8.  I insisted on replacement or refund and only after reporting to the BBB did I finally get a new oven delivered.  At this point I have been without a stove for 5 weeks and I was told that I could hire a service company to install the new oven.  This is an added cost seeing as I had already done that in October when I got the original stove.  I am now sitting with a new stove in my garage while Thor Kitchen finds a man to install the equipment.  The eye ""clicking"" has continued if you use the two double eyes forcing me to cook on the middle eye.

In closing the company has terrible customer service and does not respect their customers.  Spend the extra money and buy a brand that will stand behind their equipment and not leave you with a non-functional piece of equipment for long periods of time or insist that you rearrange your day for entirely too many repairmen.

I have now gone through 3 holidays and one birthday with no functioning oven."	0
16779	Unfortunately, these filters made my water taste like it came from a rubber hose. There is a distinct rubber / plastic aftertaste. I don't think there is any carbon in these filters since there was no black carbon discharge after installing. The original LG filter had no aftertaste even after 6 months of use. I ordered 2 of them and I tried both with the same results. The only reason I gave these 2 stars is the seller was great and provided a complete refund. I guess I'll have to just pay more for the brand name.	0

3315	"Love this washing machine.  When using the quick wash cycle 23 minutes total.  Just washed a queen sized comforter, worked great.
My water bill actually went down each of the last three months I have had this machine.  It replaced one of those eco green machines that was really awful.  Just remember to select the appropriate water fill for the load and it really works just like one of those green washers.
This washer really spins out the water which can produce wrinkles.  I use the permanent press cycle which seems to help.  My sister in law a
home economics teacher told me about Speed Queen being and exceptional washing machine without all the bells and whistles, like and old Maytag from 20 years ago.  Did not purchase from Amazon but read reviews which helped me decide.  Speed Queen includes new hot and cold water hoses that are the old rubber type and not really very good.  We purchased a new set of steel braided instead which are superior."	1

2813	"I have a Whirlpool Cabrio washer that was going off balance during the spin cycle of every load.

I bought this item for under $50 with free shipping and searched the internet for a video to help me install (Amazon removes links to videos, so search for ""Cabrio Washer Repair Suspension Rods Replacement"" and/or use the product number in your search.  You'll know it when you find it!)

I had problems opening the washer (it was a bit rusty), and I had to clean up a tad inside.  The hardest problem was threading the rod hooks up and into the balls.  It required a second person, myself to shift the wash basin upward, and the partner to thread the hook into the ball.  The toughest one to do was the right rear corner as it also has to attach to with a clip for tubing and wiring.

The rods are slightly shorter than the rods I removed.  This does not appear to be a problem, and I've monitored under the washer for spills, but found none.  So far after 3 loads, there have been zero off balance incidents.  Excellent and less expensive than someone coming out, you just need some elbow grease and strength and preferably a second person to help thread.

UPDATE: It's now almost 2 months later and the washer is doing great."	1

1. DISHES NEVER GET CLEAN
2. FOOD gets stuck CONSTANTLY!
After the first $150.00 repair bill to have a repairman use a tube to blow bubbles into the drain, we bought our own piece of tubing to make our own ^%@$! bubbles.  The bottom drawer has to be taken apart and cleaned about every other time it is used.
3. GO THRU DISH TABS
I have never used so many dishtabs in my life! I guess we didn't think about the extra tabs when having a 2 drawer dishwasher, but won't be going down this road again.

My $1800 piece of junk dishwaser is going on Craigslist and I am buying something that works.

12693	I purchased this product directly from Compact Appliance. I do not recommend buying from them. I received the Icemaker and it was awesome.  Unfortunately it quit working about a week after it was out of the 90 day manufactures warranty. I knew this was a risk you take so I purchased the extended warranty.  The ServicePro warranty was very difficult to deal with. When I first contacted them they took my report and told me they would be in contact with me. In several days I received an email that I was responsible  for contacting the manufacturer and asking them to contact the warranty company. When I reminded them it was a replacement warranty they did send me a label to send it in. After being without the Icemaker another week I received a call they would send me a check within 30 days to replace the product. The check was not for the $161 I paid for it shipping included but the cheapest place they could find it which was on Amazon for $114 without shipping. Shipping is an additional $45. The seller is Compact Appliance. I emailed Compact Appliance to let them know I was dissatisfied with the warranty company they use. I never received a response. I tried posting a review of the warranty on their website and Compact Appliance only posts reviews that they approve. I am posting this review to warn others and so you can make an informed decision. I am purchasing another Icemaker but I am trying my luck with another company.	0
51361	The unit itself is just fine and was delivered promptly. The problem is that the description is a false advertisement. It leads you to believe that the good comes with a 1500cfm blower. In actuality it comes with NO blower and the blowers are as much or more than the hood insert itself. I contacted Build.com and I was pretty much told haha we got ya!  Very dissatisfied with Amazon and Build.com over this matter.	0

308	Perfect fit,No trouble cutting off shredded old one. This snapped right in. It really cuts down on the noise too. Also less chance of accidentally dropping a spoon in as it catches most things.	1
21480	"This is the second one of these I have owned.  The first was purchased from another site, but it was the 2 fan version.  Bottom line, both only lasted 3-4 months of being on 3-4 hours per day (drinking time in afternoon to get tower cold)  The both became obnoxiously noisy and this version ended up not blowing as hard once it got cold.

I love the idea, and when they are new, they do what they say.  Still looking for a better idea."	0
2615	Amazing part, and it cost me 1/1000th of what the appliance repair people wanted to charge me for it....Crazy!!!!	1
45979	Did not fit like the original. Had to file out inner ridge in metal sleeve in order to get the motor to slide in far enough to attach	0
8376	Needed new elements for a Frigidaire 318335500 slide in Range, bought 2 of these and they fitted perfectly, just push and press down a little and bingo they're seated correctly. When turning on for first time there will be a slight burning smell, this is not unusual and will stop after a few minutes. For the price it was a lot cheaper than any of the big box stores and delivery was very quick.	1
6280	A+	1
7633	These came in a timely manner but they really do not compare to the name brand.  Sediment and some odors still got through with these filters.  Probably will not purchase again.  The name brand lasted longer also.	1
4573	"Add me to the growing list of satisfied PA Micro Dot users. Build quality is excellent as many others have pointed out. I've had no problems with it holding zero, though it stays on my 22/45 thus sees only .22lr.

If it were a more expensive optic, then I would dock a star for dot doubling/ghosting and general loss of sharpness at higher powers (above 7/8). But for $80, I can't really complain."	1

6963	I wanted to repair my front loading washing machine myself. After diagnosing what the problem was, through observation and a YouTube video, that showed me how to take apart my Washing machine, I tried ordering it through a Website, Not amazon. The customer service person sent me a diagram of the parts, which I could not understand at all. Therefore I went to Amazon and located the product at almost half the price, for OEM part, and saw a clear diagram of exactly the part and the number I needed. I was pleased with the quickness of the delivery and receiving exactly the right part.	1

7523	Perfect fit. Christmas dinner was cooking, right in the middle of a three hour cook off with 3 people in the kitchen chopping slicing and multiple pans in various stages of cooking, the stove just quit. The OEM version of this failed, allowed one of the hot legs to make contact with the unit frame and kicked the circuit breaker. I did a temp fix, insultated and Christmas cooking continued after a short 10 minute break and in the meantime, I jumped online and hunted down the replacement. Great price, looks sturdier and has been installed with out issues. Was easier than changing a flat on your car. No brainer. Just please, remember to unplug your appliance before installing.	1
8857	Terrible do not recommend. The filter would leak and if anything the water was more dirty with the new filter.	0

9501	Stay away. Five years in and the rear bearings are shot. We purchased this along with a Samsung dryer and that has been repaired two times, once for a new heating element and another for a belt. These are not discount or off brand appliances but they sure do act like them. Samsung may make good TV's but not so great appliances.	0
28014	Read the reviews here... Talking about this being a complete kit.  I was under the impression that I was ordering a seal AND bearing kit.  Only the seals showed up.  :(  Doesn't do me a hill of beans without the bearings... Now I have to order bearings.  NOT HAPPY!	0
3600	"I purchased this GARP 279816 Compatible Replacement for Dryer Thermal Fuse Kit fits most Brands from the seller Vijay Holdings and the shipping was fulfilled by Amazon FBA.

My fuse blew because I had a blocked up dryer vent. After clearing it I replaced the fuse and saw the review suggested I replace the thermostat as well. I went ahead and did and the instant I turned the dryer on the fuse blew. There was no heat for it to blow, there was just some sort of wiring issue inside the thermostat (most likely) that caused it to blow instantly. I put the old thermostat back in, bypassed the fuse until I could complete the return and get a new one, at which point I swapped the fuse and everything was working just fine.

I do want to be very clear, by instantly, I mean the second I turned the dryer on. There was no heat yet, it was simple push button, and done. Fuse was raised up and heat was cut off. I had previously tested the fuse with a multimeter so I know it was working before it was plugged in and turned on.

Vijay Holdings was a little slow in response when I emailed them to ask for help, but took the return without question. These weren't GARP, but they were some compatible piece and was unbranded."	0
7127	This is a great idea!! I can easily remove and clean!!	1
7569	My washer stopped spinning which left me with sopping wet clothes. After reading the error code and googling it, almost all results pointed to this part. Arrived quickly with Prime Shipping and took me about 15 minutes to install. There's great Youtube videos from Sears and others on how to replace it. Just remember to calibrate the washer when you're done.	1
2306	This is a beautiful and functional hood. It did take 4 men to install. It looks great and performs great. The 4 lights and quiet fan stand out in performance and as the reason we chose this hood for the island in our new open kitchen.

6175	Worked on my dryer with no issues. With varying part numbers from the manufacturer, I was worried that it would not be the correct one. But as usual, the product description was spot on.	1
7375	Filter seems well made, fit our refrigerator just fine, and the taste of the water is as good as the factory original filter provided. I wish there was an independent lab that tested these filters, but at least based on what I can see and taste, this seems like a good quality product.	1

20360	"Every time the compressor turns on, the refrigerator makes a series of loud popping noises.  I wrote the distributor, and this is what they said:

""The following describes the kinds of sounds that are to be expected:
Rattling noises may come from the flow of the refrigerant or the water line.
Items stored on top of the kegerator can also make noises.
The high efficiency compressor may make a pulsating or high-pitched sound.
Water running from the evaporator to the water bin may make a splashing or sound.
As each cycle ends, you may hear a gurgling sound due to the refrigerant flowing in your kegerator.
Cracking or popping sounds are caused by the expanding and / or contracting of the cooling coils.""

I am not hearing any of the other sounds that they say can be EXPECTED.  I work in the air conditioning/refrigeration industry.  I have never heard this kind of noise coming from a cooling coil, and if a coil is making these sounds because of expansion/contraction then the coil is being physically stressed -  this cannot be a good sign for the longevity of the unit.  Do not buy his unit if expect it to be quiet.  I will update post if the unit breaks.  Other than that...it is working well, but I will have to move it to the garage if I want to sleep at night.

After further correspondence with the manufacturer, they shipped a replacement unit!  Before it arrived, I noticed that ice had built up behind the evaporator coil on the back wall inside the unit.  I defrosted it, and it no longer makes the popping noises, which were apparently do to the ice either expanding or cracking.  They say that it does NOT have a defrost cycle, and requires manual defrost.  I will live with that, and ship back the replacement unit.  Might upgrade to four stars if I can limit the ice build up by allowing better air circulation.

Update:  I defrosted the unit and returned the replacement unit, which turned out to be a mistake.  Within a couple of days of plugging it back in, it started the loud banging noises again.  I would definitely not buy this again."	0
56978	This is a very expensive refrigerator with limited capacity. It may hold 60 cans, but if you drink from soda or beer bottles, there is no place for them. We tried to return it, and the seller, Percy's TV & Appliance, would only take it back if we paid a 25% restocking fee, which would have been $350.00, plus freight.  I haven't installed it, and I'm not sure what I am going to do with it. Quite disappointing!	0
39397	If the filter is new and directly from GE, it works great and produces wonderful tasting water. However, the 3 pack that I purchased from a third party were all defective. Within a week the water from the first one started tasting as though it was no longer filtered. So I requested and received a refund for it. The second one lasted about a month and the third about 2 months. Each should last about 6 months. Don't waste your money on third party vendors that offer a better price because the product they offer could be defective.	0

48776	We purchased our 2-drawer model in Dec. 2007 for which we paid about $1,200. They worked well except for the common complaint of water gathering in the bottom of the units. This year our top unit stopped working. Appliance repair said it was the computer unit, which cost $400. Okay. It took several weeks to receive the piece from NZ. Oops....something is wrong says the repairman...the new part doesn't work. So another couple of weeks pass, a new part arrives, is installed, and actually works. Then our bottom unit develops the same problem.  Another $400? I think not. We got a little over 6 years out of the F-P,. which really don't seem like much time. F-P customer service is non-existent.	0

5039	"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time."	1

4747	Simple swap out to get my otherwise perfectly good washer back up and running.

They are sturdy (rarely tear) and work with the buttons that attach them securely to my compactor bin. The only thing I don't like is the way they close up when you're ready to remove the full bag from the bin. I would like a better way to tie up the top. Despite this, I will continue to purchase again and again	1

28932	"the washer stop spinning one evening.  took a pencil & stick on the lid switch, it worked again.  but failed to work the next day.  suspects the lid switch. after searching the web a while, found how to bypass the lid switch by sticking a wire on the connector. bingo, the washer started working again. it was a dead switch.  order the lid switch on mar 21 & arrived on mar 26. after 20 minutes, the washer was back in action.

update: the switched died yesterday June 14.  It lasted less than 3 months. should have purchased an OEM part. You get what you paid for.

Update: This particular seller was quite gracious, NOT!  willing to sell me another one for 40% off.  or refund sans the shippping cost.  no exchange offered!

Update: June 18.  I email another seller inquiring the warranty and manufacturer of the same switch & was offered a free switch, no strings attached.  It's night and day compared to the other seller.  I'll definitely consider buying from this seller in the future."	0

5165	"I've had this for less than 5 years and it's now good for the trash.

First, upon receiving it, we had problems with the electronic control and it had to be replaced altogether. Took over a month to get the part and fix it.

Second, when the oven is used, there's a cooling fan that starts up and it's quite noisy. It doesn't stop until the oven is cool, so even after it's shut down, the fan continues to run, ruining any nice and cozy candle dinner you might have planned.

Lastly, we used the auto-clean feature for the first time after about 4 years and it simply killed the display again. We called the repair guy and just to open it and determine what had to be changed would've required to completely disassemble the thing since the door was locked in place by the auto-clean (safety measure). Even then, any part to be changed would've cost (with labour and all) around $1000. So it's now headed for the trash and we'll buy a new one.

DON'T buy any of these Kitchen Aid series."	0

Called kitchen aid, they couldn't have care less. They were more concerned with getting a second contact number from me than they were about the fact this product created an explosion in my kitchen.  And out of warranty, forget it!  I have spent the last 24 hours looking on Internet, as it turns out there are 100's of complaints with a same story.  Whirlpool Corp doesn't care!

45992	"This part is probably fine (a five star part) but all I needed was the gasket.  Because Honeywell does such a poor job engineering this device, all of us owners have had ridiculous problems.  I fought the leaky tank problem for a couple of years before I could get a new one.  A tank should NEVER develop a leak if engineered properly in the first place.  After tank replacement, my unit worked OK during last winter season.  In starting up for this season, now I have the ""six blinking"" lights error saying this part is defective.

Well, I took it apart and the contacts (just like my heating element) are bright and shiny.  I use soft water so I never get buildup.  However, upon removal, the gasket is destroyed.  It looks like it was never seated properly from the factory.  Of course, Honeywell would never admit that error!  In addition, a foam gasket is not the right material for this application. There are numerous high-temperature gasket materials available but they might cost Honeywell a dime more to use.

I am going to try and seal the unit with RTV silicone before I spend $39 for a $0.15 gasket. If that works, I will come back and update the review.  PS, the plastic electrode holder also has a crack so I will seal that as well.

Obviously, Honeywell can't engineer these devices. That is why one of my local major HVAC companies has dropped the line. To many HVAC installers get too many callbacks.  Looks like my eventual replacement will be a White Rodgers unit.  In the interim, if I can nurse this along, I will since I own it.

PS, as others have said, replacing this part is very easy so if you have ""six blinking lights"" don't hesitate to try.  The top comes off with one screw but it must be ""wiggled"" to free it up.  If you use hard water, then take the opportunity to inspect/clean your tank and heating element while you are at it.  Read the manual first."	0

3297	I have an AcuRite weather station and a similar wireless indoor/outdoor that really works well.  I bought this model to monitor my greenhouse temperature and humidity.  I originally placed the sending unit in my greenhouse and the receiver in the family room so I could easily monitor the temperature from my chair.  But I found it could not receive the signal in the family room, about 75 feet from the greenhouse so I moved it to our laundry room about 60 feet from the greenhouse and on a window ledge that faces the greenhouse.  We have a metal exterior door that is about inline with the greenhouse and the side table in the family room where I had the receiver, which may have reduced the signal strength.  I'll experiment later with different locations in the family room so I don't have to walk to the laundry room to check on my greenhouse.	1

52522	This is absolutely the worst appliance I have ever purchased.  It does not clean the dishes.  If you put in too much soap, it begins to squeak.  Then you have to run vinegar through it to clear it out.  I have a whole list of reasons not to buy it.  Just don't buy it.	0

33242	Ordered these as a replacement for the OEM MSWF filter.  It worked for about three weeks...then the water system made horrible noises and stopped dispensing water.  I thought the fridge was broken..but on a recommendation, I swapped this filter back again for the OEM GE filter...and everything works fine again.  I can only conclude that this AquaFresh filter is not compatible with, or is an acceptable substitute for, the original filter.	0

2108	This was easy to install and initially worked fine.  Then 4 months later started spurting water all over the fridge thru a pinhole leak that developed at the head.

28221	"The only cycle that cleans clothes reasonably is the extreme high heat cycle for whites. Non-whites going through any other cycle come out smelling of mildew. There is no other solution than to pre-soak clothes once or even twice, then wash them. This method works most of the time (not all of the time), but since I work a full time job it now takes nearly a day to get one small load of clothes through the soak, wash and dry cycle: I have to put them in the soak cycle when I go to bed, in the wash before work, then in the dryer when I get home. I fold before going to bed. The washer is so small that it means I am doing laundry all the time. Worse, sometimes one extra soak cycle is not enough to get the mildew smell out of clothes, so I have to run the tiny load through another day of the cycle.

Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage. Stay away from this machine."	0

1668	"At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out."	1

This filter only filters about 20% of contaminants. We tested several times.

Tap water particulates straight from our sink were at 600 ppm

We tested a Starbucks iced water we purchased in the morning for Breakfast - around 80 ppm

The water coming from this Samsung filter was about 520 ppm - that is only a 12% Reduction!

Ordered a 2nd filter, thinking maybe the first was a defect.

The 2nd filter did about the same - 520ppm - only a 12% Reduction in contaminants.

2071	This washer arrived one week ago and it works great so far. I watched a few videos on Youtube with a smaller one to get a feel about how it would work and if it would suit my needs. I'm currently a college student living in a house with a bunch of boys. We have a utility room, but I didn't want to buy a big heavy washer and then have to move it again when I graduate college. Since this is so small and light I thought it would at least be worth a shot. I set the drain hose to be where the washer drain hose would go and just fill the washer tub up with a bucket since I couldn't get the hose to fit onto anything. After I move it from the spinner I hang it on this which works great for my clothes and my boyfriend's. www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084RXWLA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3	1

In October of 2014 (one year and three months after purchase) it stopped working.  Everything I had in it was ruined, and I was told since it was out of warranty, I needed to take it somewhere locally and have it repaired.  I wanted a contact number to call so I could complain about the shoddy workmanship and inferior parts.

Worst is the fact that it clogged and my fridge started making a really horrible noise so I called the technician. $60.00 later, he told me that I had a bad filter. I told him that it was less than 3 months old. He uninstalled the filter, shaked it a  bit, installed it again and the noise was gone. He told me the noise would be back in a few days, sure enough, 3 days later the noise was back. Now I got me a REAL filter and my fridge is good as new.	0

32894	"I rarely post reviews on products, but felt compelled to share my thoughts with anyone considering purchasing this device. I recently purchased the Humiditrak as a way to monitor the humidity of a very expensive Martin acoustic guitar. I live in New England and work about 20 miles from home. It seemed like a great idea to be able to access an app and ""see inside"" my guitars case. What is not clear (to me anyway), is your smartphone needs to be within 100 FEET of the sensor for you to get updates (it does store them so you can review them after the fact). Honestly, I just don't understand the point of this device. If I'm home, I can check the humidity of my guitar by walking upstairs (if I'm, let's say, making a snack in the kitchen). I imagine the only real reason you would want a product like this is to monitor the humidify when you are away from your home, I'm I right? To be fair, you can install the app on a second device (like your ""spare"" iPhone), leave the app open and pull the data from the cloud (as the second device is uploading it). Haven't tried that yet and it sounds like a pain in the butt.

I gave it two stars because if you do read the instructions within the app, it does tell you the second device ""trick."" Also, it seems to accurately record the humidity and temp. Also, it does store those metrics throughout the day, so maybe if you care what the humidify was, say, 8 hours ago, the Humiditrak is for you (I guess if you want to look at long term humidity trends?). For me, maybe I just totally misunderstood the limitations of this product, so I guess that's my fault. However, if you purchase this product, knowing you need to be within 100 feet of the sensor, I'd love to know why..."	0

I called Amazon and they were fabulous and gave me a refund even though I had torn the package open (well, I thought it was the same thing I liked!)

I also spoke to Carol Housely at whirl pool's corporate office and said she will not replace the frig. This basically means that they do not stand by their product. She had the nerve to tell me she's a consumer as well and the same thing happen to her. I told her if that was the case she would do everything in her power to replace the frig if she new how it felt to be ripped off. She proceeded to tell me that it doesn't matter how many times the frig fails, they will not replace it. The only thing they will do is send out a repair guy. I asked what happens once the 1yr standard warranty is up. She suggested I get a extended warranty. Why would I want to give you more $. DO NOT GET THIS REFRIGERATOR. IN FACT, DON'T PURCHASE ANY WHIRL POOL PRODUCTS. I KNOW I WON'T WITH SUCH HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. ALSO IF YOU HAVE A BRANDSMART IN YOUR AREA DON'T THINK ABOUT PURCHASING ANY BIG TICKET ITEMS THERE BECAUSE THEY WILL FAIL ON YOU. I know this because my mother keeps buying product from them and they keep failing on her. The rumor is that their stuff is refurbish!!!	0

274	"I just got one of these guys, since I just moved and it seemed cheaper to buy a portable dishwasher than to pay more for rent to have an apartment with a built-in dishwasher. ANYWAY, it seems to work pretty swell. I had some dishes backed up in the sink (been busy) and I was able to do them all in 2 loads. Instead of spending 30 min or whatever it would have taken me, I loaded the dishwasher in a couple of minutes and went to work cleaning the rest of the kitchen!

Certain items are a little tricky to wash in it, like wooden spoons, spatulas, etc, but I just wash them by hand. I would venture to guess that this isn't any different in other counter-top models.

My only advice: if you have more than 2 people living in your household, go bigger - and since this is just about the biggest counter-top model, you should be looking at a different type of product."	1
7786	Did my research on a small wine fridge (8 bottles) and decided to go with this one. So far it seems great!

52799	"I like the fact that this range has a stainless steel frame which prevents hot air from coming out the sides (my last range caused one of my adjacent laminate cabinets to peel from the heat). It also has a sleek almost built in profile and the smooth black top (around the burners) is easy to keep clean (vs. a stainless steel top surface). However, I had mechanical problems the moment it was installed. There was a buzzing tone every time the heat adjusted inside of the oven. Called for service and they had to replace the interior valve and heating unit  (don't even want to know what it would have cost if out of warranty). Also, when requesting repair, Kitchenaid asks you to select which problem you are having. There was an option to select 'noisey"". Without any further information, the repairman arrived with a part that apparently kitchenaid said was needed, but was not part of the problem. So there is at least one known recurring noise issue that many of their customers are experiencing. After reading all of these reviews, I'm very worried about using the self clean feature even though the service tech said it should the first thing done to get rid of all the new and funky mechanical smells."	0

47258	"This expensive and well made hood is a terrible piece of industrial design. Most ranges have their most often used and hottest burners in the front.
So where did XtremeAir place their exhaust vent?-In the rear. So when your hot fumes and stir fry oil rises, they all head to the lights and control panel. My side cabinets and hood are covered in oil. The control panel is very hot and will probably malfunction with all that intense heat from those 10,000 BTU burner below. The unit is only 22 inches deep whereas most ranges are 26- 30 inches.  Why didn't XtremeAir  put the lights  on the side like their wall mounted hoods? Some hoods have their lights in the rear. Their response to me is that my vent does not work well and it is clogged. Do your home work and measure you burners! The vents on this unit are only 15 & 3/4 inches deep! XtremeAir should fire their designer.

3370	"Buyer Beware

I bought these filters because they claim to be a 1 for 1 replacement for the Samsung DA29-00003G Aqua Pure Plus water filter. They are NOT. Don't misunderstand, they physically fit and produce good flavored water, however they do not filter everything the Samsung filter is capable of filtering. These filters only satisfy NSF/ANSI 42 treatment standards, which are for ""aesthetic effects"". They do not meet NSF/ANSI 53 treatment standards which are for ""health effects"". I've included the descriptions directly from the NSF website on filtration standards:

NSF/ANSI 42: Drinking Water Treatment Units - Aesthetic Effects
NSF/ANSI 42 establishes the minimum requirements for the certification of POU/POE filtration systems designed to reduce specific aesthetic or non-health-related contaminants (chlorine, taste, odor and particulates) that may be present in public or private drinking water.

The scope of NSF/ANSI 42 includes material safety, structural integrity and aesthetic, non-health-related contaminant reduction performance claims. The most common technology addressed by this standard is carbon filtration.

NSF/ANSI 53: Drinking Water Treatment Units - Health Effects
NSF/ANSI 53 establishes the minimum requirements for the certification of POU/POE filtration systems designed to reduce specific health-related contaminants, such as Cryptosporidium, Giardia, lead, volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether), that may be present in public or private drinking water.

The scope of NSF/ANSI 53 includes material safety, structural integrity and health-related contaminant reduction performance claims. The most common technology addressed by this standard is carbon filtration.

Having said the above, these aren't bad filters. They do a good job of enhancing the taste of my refrigerated water, hence the 3 rating. I'm on a good public water system so that is probably actually sufficient for my (and probably your) needs and they are significantly cheaper than the Samsung filters. Recognize that you get what you pay for though. If you are worried about lead, cryptosporidium, giardia, MTBE, etc, then move along, there's nothing to see here..."	1
8246	"This is one of the best products I have purchased.  I used it ""by hand"" without an electric drill, shop vacuum or functioning dryer.  I cleaned from inside the house to outside.  Worked just fine pushing all of the lint through the duct.  Why pay $225 when you can own the equipment and clean any time you want?!"	1

5396	Bought to replace an identical unit which had the sending unit damaged by years of challenging Florida weather.  Now, I have one exterior sensor/transmitter and two inside receiver units by using both my original and the new one.  Works perfectly.	1
2078	"Outstanding, well made product.  I have a 15 ft. dryer exhaust duct made of heavy foil ""accordian"".  It's a straight run from the dryer wall to the outside of the house at near ground level except for a 90 deg ""S"" bend where the duct enters the wall and continues below the floor next to the basement ceiling

Since the total length of the rods is 12 feet, I had to clean the duct from both the outside and inside.  After reading all the options in the user manual I concluded that the most efficient cleaning method was the following general procedure.  I ran the brush through the duct from the outside (while keeping the dryer connected to the duct) and then turned on the dryer on the unheated air flow setting to blow out the debris through the louvered outside vent that the brush did not extract.  Then I disconnected the duct from the dryer to the wall and ran the brush through the duct from the inside...being careful to allow the flexible line to let the brush negotiate the two 90 deg bends.  I reconnected the dryer to the duct and again turned it on air flow to blow the debris out the outside louvered vent that the brush didn't remove.

DETAILS: When cleaning from the outside, I attached the brush to one 3-ft. rod and attached it to my drill.  It's best to have a two speed drill (set at the low speed) or a variable speed drill.  The outside vent is plastic with three flexible louvers which are easy to remove.  I inserted the brush into the end of the duct, turned it on, slowly worked the brush into the duct the full length of the rod, and slowly withdrew the rotating brush (and watched all the debris being pulled out).  I did that three times. I then turned on the dryer (unheated air flow) to ""clear"" the duct.  After that I rotated the brush again into the duct to near the end of the rod, disconnected it from the drill, attached the second rod and repeated the process.  I reinserted the brush to near the end of the second rod, disconnected it from the drill, attached the third rod and repeated the process....etc... until I had all four rods (12 ft.) attached.  When I finished cleaning from the outside, I cleaned the duct from the inside, but I just needed to use one 3-ft. rod. to ensure the entire 15 ft run was cleaned.  Of course, don't forget to clean out the duct that connects to the  dryer.  I also opened the back of the dryer and cleaned the inside.  The debris sitting on the grass below the louvered vent was easily cleaned with a house vac using the suction tool.

Be patient, read the instructions and pay close attention to what it says about connecting and securing the rod sections.  Also, wear a good quality dust mask and hat.  If you have a long duct like mine, don't connect all four rods at once and then try to insert the brush and run the drill from 12 feet away -- it'll be too unwieldy.  Simply start with one 3-ft rod and add the additional ones to the rods that are inserted in the duct and protruding from the opening as described above and continue rotating the brush.  Push the brush in slowly and let it do the work; don't force it.  If you apply a little common sense it's really very simple.  But the whole cleaning process will take a long time, especially if you have to also clean from the inside which requires moving the dryer, disconnecting the duct and other contortions...so be patient.  It's a well-made, effective tool that really does the job."	1

12603	I needed an adapter to attach a Moentrol faceplate to the valve. This is advertised to fit a Positemp model but since I could not find a plaster ground for the Moentrol, and this is described as fitting a single handle valve, I though I would try this cause it's cheap enough. Bottom line, screws for the faceplate didn't line up, so it's now a useless piece of plastic. I messed up the part and cannot return it. Be advised, it does not fit a Moentrol model.	0

19766	We were pretty excited about this dishwasher when we received it. The reviews seemed to be great, so I had high hopes for this. We ran two cycles through this before deciding that it wasn't for us. It didn't seem to get the dishes clean. We would rinse our dishes before running them in the dishwasher, but obviously just short of actually washing the dishes before hand, you are going to have some leftover residue on the dishes when you put them in the dishwasher. When they came out our silverware had gunk on them that wasn't there prior. I also washed a plastic cup in there that was dishwasher safe and it shrunk the cup. Almost like it melted it. The dishwasher was pretty and I liked that the interior was stainless. But nonetheless, it didn't do the job that was intended. I returned it after a month of use, so that I could get my money back. Otherwise this seemed like it was a good idea and the unit itself was easy to hookup and use.	0
1583	Fits as advertised, Saved $$$ on a callout fee to fix dryer by doing it myself. What's not to like.	1
5596	Good price and fast service.  I am very happy with this and i plan to buy more of these very soon as in right away.	1
6017	I received this item in a flimsy cardboard package. The filter itself was significantly bent. This could have been avoided if it had been packaged similar to other filters I've ordered from various companies. I had to bend it back in place to get it to fit into its designated slots in the microwave. Still not a perfect fit because of the crease, but it will do. The filter was a perfect match, just receiving a slightly damaged product was aggravating.	1

9105	"First--this silverware basket, made for a top-of-the-line KitchenAid dishwasher wore out in five years--plastic parts broke out of the bottom and into my dishwasher drain line.  Silverware was constantly falling through the holes it left.  I've owned dishwashers for many years that never had problems with the silverware basket.  Now they're being made out of cheap plastic and we're being charged $$$ to replace them...WITH THE SAME CRAP!

Second--the handle on the center of the basket shown in the picture isn't on the replacement basket.  So it's off-balance and tilts precariously when you take it out of the dishwasher.  My husband had to fish the old basket out of the trash and pry off the old handle and put it on this basket so that it wouldn't tilt and spill as it was being taken out of the machine.

American companies used to sell products that their customers could rely on.  Those days are gone."	0

I later found out the the doors were about 1 inch uneven. it looked like something from the beetle juice movie.  so in October 2014 I thought why not maybe I just had a bad one.  took off from work t be here 6 times to get the doors some what close to good.  2 days before thanksgiving this new one died and it took today to get it fixed but I am worried as it did not even start to cool off yet.  stay away from GE products and never ever take a deal from them directly.  http://www.consumeraffairs.com/homeowners/ge_refrigerators.htm	0

7742	"Bought this refrigerator recently to replace a 2yr old Samsung 4door Flex. There are a lot of complaints that this unit is loud but my wife and I don't find that to be true, especially when compared to our last fridge. It does have two ice makers which means double the ice drops but that is the only noise we hear. Our house has a great room so the kitchen is just feet away thus if it were loud we would hear it.
The layout of the fridge is great especially having the slide drawer for the produce. You also have the other drawer that has multiple cooling selections depending on what you want to put in. This is a great buy and would recommend it. I do wish it had been out a little longer so we could see long term how it works but as I do anymore I bought an extended warranty for an extra $200. I can say that the Amazon price is WAY off as we got ours for $2,950.00 out the door with delivery and warranty."	1

1:  From an existing RPWFE filter remove the RFID and place it in the filter container over the RFID reader.
2:  Insert the Pure Green RPWF water filter with the proper sticker showing the month it was inserted
3:  You will see that it says ""Expired"".  Don't worry about it.  Its just reading the old RFID, it will work just fine.

17108	"I had the previous version of this dryer and I loved it.  It had all the features I needed and worked great until it broke shortly after the year long warranty expired.

The dryer developed a crack and a golf ball sized hole in the drum.  We weren't abusing the dryer, we used it daily for a family of 3 with reasonable sized loads.  I was told to repair it would cost $220 for the drum itself and I never got around to asking how much the serviceman would charge to install it.  I took a small piece of the drum off that was hanging next to the hole and it was made of a very, very thin metal (stainless?) covered by paint on both sides.  It's not surprising it broke being as thin as it is.  If Amana sold a heavier duty drum (I called Amana and they don't) I would have considered repairing it, but I'm not ready to fork over that kind of money every few years as drums crack and break.

I'm very disappointed in Amana's quality.  I loved the dryer, but was expecting to get more than 2 years of use out of it.  The dryer it replaced was my wife's grandmothers and that one was built in the 1950s and still going strong when we replaced it for the energy efficiency.

My recommendation: take a good look at the warranties of any dryer you're going to purchase.  If the company isn't willing to back up their work with more than a one year limited warranty, there's probably a reason why.

Edited to add: I did a little research found that Speed Queen is one company makes washers and dryers with a great warranty, which shows they stand behind their products. They have a LIFETIME warranty on their washer and dryer drums, not a one year warranty like Amana and many other brands I looked at."	0

6228	"This boot seal was easy to install.  We had a leak in our 9 year old washer, which was due to a tear in the boot seal. I first used $3 vulcanizing rubber cement (bike tire repair kit) to fix one of the tears, but found another tear where it bends that the cement wouldn't hold.

This went on in no time.  First, take off outer ring.  Then push torn seal into washer.  Find nut above seal and use a socket wrench to loosen then take off inner ring.  Put new seal on by doing everything in reverse.  Have some patience with the inner ring it needs to be worked on.  You'll be done in 15-20 minutes."	1

'Anyway, I will install just to prevent wasting my time of trying a short-sighted fix, and maybe will report back after install.

14046	"Two problems with this unit:

1. Often leaves soap on clothes and they have to be washed twice. I think this is related to the water level problems where it doesn't fill high enough. It's automatic so can't be manually adjusted

2. I can't believe no one has mentioned that the water shuts off when you open the door when it's filling with water.  Most washers I've seen continue to fill the drum while the top is open.  I see this as a huge problem because I can't rinse off the soap cup and it becomes covered with soap residue.  I don't have a sink in my laundry room to rinse it.  I realize this may seem petty but it's a huge inconvenience for me.  I give it two stars because it works otherwise."	0

The quality is fantastic as well. I bought a different one earlier on Amazon but that one did not have good quality and water leaked everywhere.  The hose is of extreme thickness and I forsee it lasting for many years.

Tips: Just make sure that you tighten this enough because it will leak if it is not tight. Make sure you also put those washers in they are vital to keeping the water  where it belongs.

Overall I would recommend this to anybody and everybody as it is exactly as described and great quality. Unmatched price as well and will save you a trip to the hardware store"	1

8237	"This Y303404 [Maytag number] element/housing assembly is not a Maytag/Whirlpool OEM part [it is an aftermarket]. But it worked out very well.
What attracted me to it was Amazon's fantastic price [24.00]. The only initial snag was that it was not the part # listed for my Dryer but the dimensions were identical.  My dryer is a Maytag DE7500 model which calls for a Y303778 assembly. The dealers I called said they were not listed as interchangeable parts but did not know why. So I rolled the dice and ordered this one. The only visual difference is that the  Y303778 sheet metal tube is in two halves that are sheet metal screwed together. The Y303404 sheet metal tube is a one piece round duct, like a furnace duct. Diameter and length are exactly the same.
This replacement would have worked right out of the box, if not for this simple modification. One of the two sensors that have to be transferred from your old housing fastens to one of the two flanges where the halves screw together. This Y303404, being perfectly round of course, has no flange to fasten it to. Simply measure and mark the exact same location on the new tube and find or make a small, metal 90 degree angle piece and drill and fasten it to the spot marked with 2 sheet metal screws. This will create a flange similar to your original tube. I have many parts to choose from but do you know what worked out better that anything? The little universal, multi-holed sheet metal angle piece that came with one of my son's ""Erector"" sets. I cut it to 2 or 3 inches long and I was off to the races.
I did find only one complaint on this part, in the reviews, that the tube came apart after a while where is was spot welded together. They  manufacturer must have read that, because the one I received had been drilled and a sheet metal screw installed at one end. I don't know why they just installed one screw, but I drilled & screwed two more holes at the center and at the other end to ensure no problems [total of 3]. Just don't drill right at the spot welds.
So that's it and I am very happy with this product. The price for this assembly is great [24.00]. My original Y303778 at Amazon was 99.00 and was 124.00 at the online dealer. Bargain, huh?
T'care,
MR"	1

14192	"This dishwasher was extremely quiet when we first got it. Occasionally I would listen for the faintest sound to make use I didn't forget to start it. However, cleanliness of the dishes was another issue. The dishes looked clean, but didn't feel clean. I think the dishwasher just pre washes it so you can finish the job by hand.

Not a month later the dishwasher started beeping, and not completing cycles. In order to, maybe, get the dishwasher to wash the dishes I had to turn the circuit breaker off that feeds the dishwasher, and switch it back on after a minute. This was the ritual if I wanted to use the dishwasher, and my breaker box is in a basement. I called Frigidair for warranty coverage, the first two repair companies didn't even show.  The third made it worse, and broke my sink drain. I had to hire a plumber to fix what their sub contracted repair guy broke. Now it's so loud, I'm afraid it's going to rattle something loose when it doesn't complete its cycle.

To sum it up, only buy this dishwasher if you plan to continue to wash your dishes by hand, and just want a space filler; or, you want your dishes semi clean with a bit of grime."	0

These are knockoffs, and they are not safe. Stay away! An actual Samsung water filter will have the Samsung logo on it, and the label will fade from dark blue to light blue. The correct item is pictured in the product photo. If you get a white filter without the Samsung logo on it, you received a fake. I attached a picture of both the box and the filter so you all know.

I hate to think about what I drank with this in my refrigerator. Probably some terrible chemicals based on the taste. STAY AWAY FROM THESE!!!"	0
3908	While looking for a pulley for the Whirlpool washer I found the opportunity to replace the handle that was broken. Wound up buying two because it was such a good deal.	1
1688	I bought a six-pack of these wicks because, even though we have a water softener, we always seem to get a mineral build up on the wicks, and since we go through several each season, I thought these would be more economical.  Unfortunately, they don't last as long as the other more expensive brand.  We are only getting about one week out of each of these before the top part gets a build up, and then dries out so the humidifier doesn't function well.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and soaked the wick in a vinegar water solution, but that only extended the life another few days. With the other brand, I usually got at least three weeks out of each wick.  Disappointed.  I would love it if someone would invent a wick made from cotton that you could toss in the washer.	0
42014	"At first it worked.. then it had problems.  After a while the temperature was not reading correctly.  Then it got stuck on one temperature.  Moved the sensor different places.

Took the batteries out of the sensor and the thermometer keeps reading a temperature.  What's up with that?

Maybe I just have a defective device.  Don't know.  But I'm attaching a picture.  BTW, it is actually 19 degrees outside, although the sensor is not outside."	0
20359	Purchased for my LG refrigerator.  I had no problems with the install,  perfect fit and no different than the OEM.  However,  I am not pleased with the performance of this filter.  The taste of chlorine in the water is now somehow stronger than straight from the tap and the overall water quality is dramatically poorer than the old OEM filter that was well at the end of life at nearly 2 years old.  I flushed about 3 gallons through it at install and another 3 or so since which isn't improving anything.  I wanted it to work for 1/2 the price but no luck. Thankfully I saves the old filter and it is back in for now.	0
22607	"DO NOT BUY!!!

We are past the return deadline so we can't do anything.  We installed this appropriately.  It is different than previous models but does still fit as long as you follow the old directions (not to twist) even though the pins/tabs are in a different place.  But ours was defective.  We ran the appropriate water through 2-3x more so than instructed and the water still tasted and smelled awful.  Its not an issue with the water line or fridge.  It only happened when we used this filter.

I agree with another review I saw on here By Fonfelon December 27, 2016
I first bought a $3 bulb at a local store that said it was for all appliances that use a 40 watt bulb.
It lasted about 6 months. It's difficult as a senior citizen to get to it to replace in my oven. So I got on Amazon online
and ordered a $14 bulb from South Bend Range that said it was just for ovens. Received it a few days before Christmas .
The day after Christmas my son installed it for me using rubber gloves. Always heard not supposed to
touch surface of light bulbs with out gloves. It lasted less than 3 weeks. Never waste my money on this expensive
type bulb again. Could have been how it was packed. Should have complained to Amazon. This one bulb was
in about a 12""x12"" box alone on TOP of a lot of bubble wrap. Not on a shrink wrap card or in a sleeve and touching
the cardboard lid. If I could I would give it NO STARS!"	0
29219	This product is expensive.. It's worth for $12.	0
56	filters work very well in my Samsung refrigerator, and price is significantly better than OEM.  Only issue is sometimes the small tube of silicon lubricant that comes with each filter is dried out and unusable.  When this happens I use the lubricant from other partially used tubes I've kept.  I'm not sure how essential using this lube is anyway.	1
2479	The filter works good and the cost is so reasonable compared to purchasing it in a store. Hope it will last for at least a year. If so I will purchase it again and rate it 4 or 5 star!!!	1
932	Easy as pie.	1
1851	Easy install and works great. Had to wait a few days before it started making ice. Not sure what that issue is. Perhaps needs to cycle many times to purge air in the lines. Also, the valve came with the tube which I had ordered separately (Frigidaire 218976915 Tube for Refrigerator). OK, so now I have a spare tube.	1
7122	I ordered this from OJ Commerce on 03/09/2018. My refrigerator arrived early. It was very well packaged. I waited for awhile to post a review because I wanted to give it time to see if it worked well. It is very quiet (it does make a little bit of noise when it cycles on, but every refrigerator does, and it is not very loud). It keeps my beverages, sauces, and meats very cold. The interior is extremely well designed and the shelves and door slots are very sturdy! I am extremely happy with my Danby 1.7cuft compact refrigerator. I showed it to my son and he is seriously considering purchasing one too. All of my family and friends are very impressed with the design and workmanship, as am I. Excellent compact fridge that I would highly recommend.	1

I received this as a gift on Christmas of 2016 and after I finally got it set up this freezer lasted only ONE YEAR (give or take a week) and then the starter or compressor died.  Unfortunately for me that means it's now 14 months since the actual purchase date and thus outside the measly 1 year warranty.  Plus, even if it was covered, Curtis (the parent co) said I would've had to pay for shipping to send it back for repair under warranty - and for something this size and weight that's practically the cost of the freezer itself!  So to anyone who is considering this freezer, please look elsewhere, or at least get yourself some kind of extended warranty that would cover the extra $150 s+h bill"	0

29286	I spent a great deal of money on what I had been led to believe was a quality product, but I have had nothing but problems with their double drawer dishwasher, and it has now completely ceased from working at all.	0
3629	I used this for a 650 and found it was not a perfect replacement; the problem appears to not be relevant to other models based on the reviews (but factory replacement part # is the same).  My factory fan was made of black plastic and has a thick hub piece, and I found that the stock motor had a much longer shaft than this replacement. There was no way to use this replacement motor without changes to the fan because there was no way to attach the fan to the motor itself -- the shaft wasn't even long enough to go through the fan hub.  I had to machine down the hub on the fan to make this work.  It looks like it is really intended for use with the metal-fanned units.  Also, none of the screw holes were pre-threaded, although the aluminum is soft enough that it isn't too difficult to do even just using the supplied screws.	1

8134	"Delivery was fast which was the first day of the scheduled window. The delivery men were polite and efficient. They opened the shipping box for my inspection. It arrived in excellent condition. The next day, I tested the heating temperature by placing 2 Taylor thermometers in the middle of the oven and set the oven to 350 F.  After 30 minutes of heating, I realized that the oven's default setting was about 13 degrees too high. So, I read the manual on how to change the default temperature. I lowered it by 13 degrees F. It was very easy to do.
Now it is 100 percent accurate. The true test for my oven was baking popovers and angel food cake. They both turned out awesome. Then, I used the convection roast mode for seasoned and breaded chicken loins. They too were done to perfection; crispy on the outsides and moist in the insides. I am soooo pleased with my new oven. My recommendations if purchasing this oven are to make sure to calibrate the temperature and periodically check again if you notice changes. (As ovens age, their default temperature may change too.) I would also recommend getting a convection cookbook because GE did not supply one."	1

5157	The ice maker would freeze up the water input tube and no water would enter the ice maker. Took it apart and thawed the ice out of the input tube  numerous times but in a few days it would refreeze solid again. I then insulated the input tube with no success as I thought the exterior air flow on the tube for some reason was causing the freeze up. I finally found a video on Youtube showing that if the water valve seeps/leaks a small amount of water, over time it will build up a frozen ice layer that builds up until the input tube is full of ice and no water makes it to the ice maker. I replaced this valve and the problem is cured and the ice maker works like it should. The kit had all of the parts needed. It fits quite a few different configurations so there is a bag of extra fittings and adapters. It took about 30 minutes to compete the change over using basic wrenches and nut driver/small socket set and it has been in for 1.5 months and is working good. Saved a lot of $$ and my wife is very pleased.	1
58116	"I've tried three exhaust fans (two from BV) in my attempt to find an more economical alternative to some ludicrously priced fans sold locally (Pacific / Sanyangpai / Pac-Air / Sakura).  These options start at over half a grand for the basic models and run into the four digits.

Unfortunately both BV products I've ordered I've also returned.  This product checked all the boxes in terms of functionality, high CFM, stainless, ""Euro"" design removable grills, led lights, the works.  However on receipt one of the two fans was not balanced correctly and would grind against its housing if turned on.  I'd imagine it would eventually shatter if left running.

The two star rating is due to quality control, as the other BV fan had a grill that could not be unlatched.  I'm sure with enough attempts you can end up with a usable product."	0

6944	You have to have these.  No more dropping nastiness between the stove and countertop.  They stay in place and wipe clean.	1
58597	While this may be a suitable replacement for the original, it did not fit our refrigerator properly. I was able to make it work with slight modifications however.	0
18245	Didn't even last a month. It's just sitting here in my office.	0
14659	Does not replace a KIP5801 as stated. Do not waste your time ordering this. The interior bears no resemblance to the knob it should replace.	0
39817	Piece of crap. Didn't work more than 2 days before the ice shovel got stuck in the forward position and wouldn't allow the ice-making cycle to continue. Where is the quality control on this product? It looks nice, all shiny and well rounded, but like many human beings, ultimately dysfunctional. They damn well better give me my money back or allow me to exchange it for another brand or I'm going to raise hell.	0
4590	"I need to qualify my comments by indicating that we purchased the unit from Lowe's (Model # WFW8300SW) JUST a couple weeks ago... but so far, so good. Got 10% off so it was around $720 before tax and extended warranty. Unexpectedly had to replace my 12-year old top-loading Maytag. But maybe for the best considering its capacity. Previously clothes would pile up in a hurry with our 6-person household; resulting in mildewed/moldy clothes (read RUINED) and an overwhelmed stay-at-home wife/mom. Now we (OK, my wife) can pound out 2-3 loads a day and stay up to speed with the dirty laundry we produce daily.

PROS:

--Anticipated Durability (Consumer Reports indicates Whirlpool has lowest repair-rate for front-loaders.

--Quiet.

--Super clean (and pretty dry) clothes.

--SGreen: supposedly consumes way less water and electricity than top-loaders (too little experience to say for sure).

CONS:

--Hecho en Mexico. Is anything made in the States anymore?? (at least it's closer than China). A lot of Americans out of work/make less money so that Whirlpool can make more $$$. Such is life I guess. Jumping off my soapbox now.

--Out-of-the-box warranty is short-lived... but that's common now among washers (refer to Consumer Reports for more on this)."	1

4056	I bought this when it had a great discount price for a pack of 4...at that time i didn't need to use it immediately, now when my current filter is about to be replaced, i was so excited to use this product that i bought from Amazon, once i install it my fridge started leaking...when i put my old filter the leak stopped...this mean one thing, that this product is really crappy and broken!	0
9012	first one is working longer than the supposed heavy duty one i stuck in the first time, but maybe I damaged the other brand I used the first time, I have plenty for spares now. no more going to laundry mat while waiting for parts.	1
14288	The Dryer worked great until it did not. The Dial to select a cycle was always an issue it did not change cycles unless you turned it very slowly. Now it is totally none functional and is stuck on Normal and will not move. Then last week two nights in a row the dryer came on by its self I know sounds like it is haunted. But seriously my wife and I were in the room just yesterday when we both saw the timer light up and the dryer started. The service tech who we called said the control board was shorting out unplug it immediately. WOW. So new control board and timer $600.00 and service tech to install $275.00 repairs cost more then a new unit. This is a real Dog stay away a dryer should last longer then 2 years and 4 month.	0

123	I purchased one of these from a local hardware store.  It doesn't get that cold especially if the weather is warmer.  The unit is extremely loud, a lot louder than a full sized fridge.  I feel like this fridge is trying to be a Sub Zero but it comes nowhere close.  If you're in the market for a mini fridge, do not let the glass doors sell you on this one.  The construction isn't that great.  I can't think of anything good to say.  There are a lot of different brands that sell mini fridges without the glass door and are a lot cheaper/better alternative.	0
5962	Perfect! We went to 2 big box stores and a local hardware store. Could not find right ones. These were less and fit perfectly.	1

50461	It was not the correct thermocouple but then there was no way for me to get the correct one as W. Puck has not made them available. So I took a chance and tried another ovens thermocouple so it`s not this manufacturers fault that it did not work in my Puck Oven and once installed I can not return it.	0
47136	I'm not really sure what it is supposed to do. If it is supposed to somehow affect the water so that there is not build-up in my dishwasher, then it is not working very well.	0
44969	I ordered these filters because they said they worked with the Samsung. Not once but twice these faulty filters broke in my refrigerator and allowed water to spew out the front of the refer ruining my wood floors. I wrote them and no one replied.

44379	"I bought this product a while back, but never used it. Then I got hooked on watching Youtube and the tutorials posted about doing twist outs and what products should be used on 4b/4c hair, which is my hair type. I noticed that Miss Jessie's Curl Pudding made frequent appearances in those videos and decided to give it a try, as part of my twist out process.  I untwisted my hair, expecting curl definition and didn't get it. Instead, my hair came out poufy and continued to expand to amazing levels as it dried. Essentially, I had a fright wig with little curls on the ends.  But I just figured that I did something wrong and had to tweak my process. No biggie.

What I did notice was that at first MJCP had my hair reaaaalllly soft. Those of you with my hair type would appreciate the joy of discovering a product that actually adds moisture to hair that can easily become dry and coarse. However, just a few minutes later, my hair was drier than usual and had a crispy texture to it. I was so disappointed. MJCP was not cheap. I will continue to use my S-curl moisturizer. Laugh all you want, but that stuff works!!"	0
4581	This replacement allowed my disposal to work again!  I was starting to think I would have to replace the disposal once the original stopper began to break and make using the disposal difficult to use.  Ordering and delivery were simple and on time.  Everything about this order went well.	1
19493	This new model does not lasted, after about one month the water start to trickle down to a stop so you have no choice but force to buy a new one at $50 each. They make minor change to the head of the filter so you cannot buy an older version which cost $26 from APEC water. Their GE dishwasher quality is also very poor, mine lasted 2 years with light use and have to replace due to leaks and cheap material. I will never buy any GE products from now on.	0
7595	Not much to say except that it is potentially a fairly easy fix to a dryer that won't start.	1

35154	Didn't fit in our fridge. Supposedly this will work as a replacement for Sears/Kenmore 2255520, but it seemed to be a little bit too long? When we tried to install the filter, the cap wouldn't turn to lock into place. Kind of disappointed as there seem to be very few filters out there for this fridge model. :\	0
32230	I have had no problem with my previous MWF refrigerator water filter but this particular one that I have purchased from amazon made the water taste funky. It says that the filter is to be changed every six months but within two months of using this filter, there was a metal aftertaste in the water.	0
28956	Cheap product..started to leak already. Not even 2 months use yet.	0
6942	This really ticks me off.  The claim is these fit any Samsung refrigerator.  They DO NOT.  The pictures need to show the TOP of the filter.  That is a dead giveaway that they are not the same as the ones I am looking for.	0
8584	Lid switch fits and works perfectly with the kenmore 90 series washing machine.	1
104	Buy two sets of this for the LG Sidekick pedestal washer and get braided stainless steel and metal Y's for all your washing and dryer machine needs. This is MUCH cheaper than the big box stores..	1
59976	The back splash seemed like it would have been a good buy if I had gotten to use it. Like another reviewer, mine arrived with two corners bent, one so badly it was curled back upon itself. Granted it's not commercial grade stainless steel, but it would still take considerable force to bend it like that. Unfortunately, UPS delivery leaves the package and runs, leaving me no opportunity to refuse delivery. Since it has happened to other buyers, Amazon obviously is not paying attention to product and packaging feedback.	0

6925	I saved having to buy a new washer.... then the agitator dogs needed replacing too. ... 3 of 4 agitator dogs were broken so if you purchase this part, a much easier fix that is likely needed is the agitator assistant with dogs.  less than $30 instead of buying and deliverning a new washer, plus disposal of the old!	1

First filter I put over 20 gallons through in an attempt to flush with no improvement. Water was always cloudy, tasted salty, and left a residue on a glass.

Contacted Whirlpool who quickly sent me a new filter!

Sadly filter #2 still has the same issues after 10+ gallons. It is not as bad as the first filter, but still isn't 1/100th the original filter I threw away...

With all the recent bad similar reviews, I would avoid this filter!"	0

30091	I was satisfied for the first year and had this unit. 14 months later it just died. Ruining almost 300$ worth of meat and deer sausage. Read other reviews stating the same thing. Absolute disappointment with Igloo. Last one I buy ever.	0
34616	This was dead on arrival. I should have listened to the other reviewers. Machine had some sort of burnt smell to it when it arrived but I ignored it and plugged it in. The machine sucked the water up thru the tubing and it just sat there. Fan was not pushing air, so I am not sure if that was the problem. Save yourself the headache of returning this item and find a different one.	0
51486	"Water filter caused leaking from filter area, which flooded everything on my first/top shelf. I removed and reinserted multiple times to ensure filter was situated correctly in the housing. It was not until I ordered the LG water filter bypass plug that I realized it was the filter causing the issue. Although cheaper than ""official"" LG filters, I don't think it's worth the hassle to try to save a few bucks."	0
55945	"THANK YOU to the two reviewers who figured out how to replace the poor quality plastic bolts with metal nuts and screws. Brilliant!  Why can't Whirlpool build it like that in the first place???
  One suggestion though. Use shorter stop nuts. Our stop nuts are hitting the utensil basket, and won't pass (see photo). So we're going back to the hardware store.  But many thanks for putting us on the right track!!"	0

22210	Do not buy this if the problem you're trying to fix is the leaking of the original unit - the replacement leaks as well.  Plus you have to attach the original hoses to very tiny nipples located up inside this thing and you'll never get the seal right or you'll break off something.  I even tried buying hose clamps but because they give you no room to work with, you won't solve the leaking problem.  Ditch the entire GE design and try to find a replacement faucet with connecting hoses attached.	0

  Be sincere: We welcome your honest opinion about the product or service. We do not remove reviews because they are critical. We believe all helpful information can inform our customers buying decisions.

According to the seller, it is supposed to be a replacement for my refrigerator. However, it's not. Also, the install video is of some guy fumbling around with the spring, trying to install it. I don't know if it's the right spring. I do know that it doesn't go where they say it goes. And, they don't respond to my questions."	0
4208	THIS FILTER IS GREAT.  THE ONE THAT CAME WITH THE HUMIDIFIER HAD NO BLUE COVER ON IT AND IT WAS AWFUL.  THIS ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE RE-WET CONSTANTLY AND IT DOESN'T TURN BROWN.  I RECEIVED IT ON TIME AND THE PRICE WAS GOOD.  I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS FILTER.	1
28960	Overpriced and doesnt work. I have the fan inlet pointed toward the back of the fridge (where the coils are located) and have tried the tube at every inch interval up my tower. Very little to no effect on first pour foam. I will say it is very quiet while running, but thats the best thing I can say about it.	0
19022	Didn't work with my LG refrigerator until I modified the filter.	0
52086	This is truly the most useless purchase I have made in years. Off our kitchen is a 3 season room, I placed the sensor less than 10 feet from the base. Between the kitchen and this room is a French door, so between the sensor and the base is 10 feet and a single pane of glass with direct line of sight. No signal. In fact, the only arrangement that seems to work is when the remote sensor is right next to the base. So, if you need 2 indications in the same space, this is the product for you.	0
45677	"This dishwasher is a joke!  It takes FOREVER to run, has to be run on ""heavy"" to get anywhere close to clean, and the soap dispenser often doesn't open when it's supposed to... leaving soap residue all over the dishes and coating the door.  This is best used as a dish drying rack- you wash the dishes by hand and put them in here to dry.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!"	0

6319	We live off grid in northern Minnesota and run a very small solar system and this is amazing! I have a small under counter fridge but the freezer is very tiny and always occupied. To work like we do and have cold drinks and ice to chew is a godsend  we plugged it in and noticed zero draw on our solar bank as we were in float charge at the time. The ice came out in 6-7 minute intervals on the small cube setting and i couldn't be more happy! The ice machine is less than a draw than the fridge we habe, so if u are off grid and using a cooler (we did for a while) and hate buying ice, this is an excellent option. Right now the sunshine is literally pumping out ice cube after ice cube  love love love!	1
11081	Both the amazon product page and the filter package claim this filter replaces the LG original filter model ADQ36006101 but I find that it does not. I followed the directions and I cannot fit this filter in. I can easily remove and put the original filter that came with my new fridge but the same steps do not get this filter in. Very disappointed! When doing a side-by-side comparison of this filter to the original one I can clearly see that the tips are slight different. This filter has a slightly longer tip. This is going back.	0
41552	"After reading the great reviews for this item, I decided to purchase one. Like others, mine came in a little bit dented but i'm ok with that; stuff happens during shipping and its purely cosmetic.

Since plugging it in, the temperature inside has not cooled at all and the instruction manual / troubleshooting faq is worthless. Yes, it is plugged in, the circuit breaker is not tripped, and no, the freezer temperature control is not set to ""OFF"". Now I have successfully completed their troubleshooting guide.

I expected more help from their website however it is incomplete and main phone number is a general answering machine. Any type of support or help is nonexistent and now trying to troubleshoot this problem on my own. A couple of more tries and going to have to ship this monstrosity back for a refund. It's a shame too because of the positive reviews but this seems like it's DOA."	0

30677	"I had ordered GE WR57X10032 Ice Maker Water Valve but I got the part number WR57X10051R. The packaging also had a sticker for WR57X10032 and had some connector pins so I assumed it was the same part with two different names/numbers.

However, I had issues while installing - the electrical pins did nor fit properly and I broke part of the fridge pin trying to install the part. I also bend the pins on the part when trying to fit them. Very unhappy with this - I managed to put electric tape around the pins but because the parts are not identical, I damaged the electrical pins on my fridge.

I don't recommend buying this part  as WR57X10032"	0
56491	"All it does is spin for up to 5 minutes (could use a longer timer).  Clothes still need to be hung up in the sun or in front of a fan to completely dry them.

Bigger than I expected, no room in my kitchen for something like this so I have it on a table in the garage.  it never wants to start without violently shaking, no matter how small or large a load, so I have to stop and adjust the load once or twice.  Sometimes it won't start spinning unless I bang on the side of the unit, which cracked the plastic and  had to tape up with duct tape.

I just wanted something to dry the clothes (shorts and shirts) I wear to the gym or when doing yard work.  This time of the year I may change them 3 or more times a day, to have dry clothes for a little while.  Then I soak the sweaty clothes in the sink and need to dry them.  Otherwise I would waste too much water and electricity and time running the big washer and dryer too often.

I'll get fed up with this thing and trash it in a few months, I think.

It quit working a few weeks ago.  What a wasted of money.  I could have run the electric dryer for 15-20 minutes many times to spend as much for electricity as I spent for this crap."	0
15304	Great price, but it didn't fit my frig like it said it would. Water leaked all over floor after I put it in. Had bought two, so I tried the other one, thinking I didn't put it in right, but same thing happened. Well, you get what you pay for.	0

10835	Water pressure started to drop dramatically after a couple months of use.  And there was never enough ice in the ice maker.  Thought there was some kind of water line or pressure problem, but my wife read the instructions learned this is a bad filter.  I bought a 3 pack of Waterdrop filters for the price of HALF one of these LG filters.  Pressure returned to normal and water tastes great.	0
31432	"Purchased this item and 8 months later it is useless.

Was very excited to get this and hopeful that the days of buying ice would be over!  For the first week it was so neat - a little noisy, and the ice cubes melted incredibly fast - but then, what do expect when they all have holes in them...  So there are these rods, and they get super cold, enough to freeze the water around them - so you have these little playing dice sized cubes with a hole in the middle, where the rod was.

Melted REALLY fast, and always kind of watery - the bin wasn't cold enough to keep them frozen for long at all, but it was okay for what we needed... for a bit...

The bin and all the parts inside started getting moldy SUPER fast.  We figured with constant use we could go maybe a week without shutting it down and doing a thorough cleaning - but no, we ended up just using the ice to keep the sodas cold.  I wouldn't put ice from this machine inside my drink now for anything - there are too many tiny areas that are too difficult to get to and I could never get it completely clean.

But still - it kept our drinks cold, we were okay.

Then today - the red light indicating the bin was full went on, and the bin wasn't full.  We've tried everything, gone online and researched it, and basically what we're being told is to just call it dead.  While we might be able to get the manufacturer to repair/replace, we would have to pay the shipping and some kind of co-pay that would make it much more worthwhile to put the money towards a better one and call the bit we paid for this one - a valuable learning experience.

Learn from our mistakes. :)  Also, I encourage everyone to wait a year before reviewing appliance-type purchases.  Lots of things that work great for the first while end up as doorstops, and I think a year is a fair trial to see if the item you bought possesses true quality or not.  Just a thought. :)"	0

632	"We bought this same refrigerator about five years ago.  Since then we have had repeated problems with it.  The doors had to be replaced once.  The ice maker was replaced four times, one time when it started breaking up and mixing shards of plastic with the ice.  We could have been killed.
This last time the ice maker flooded the kitchen within two hours.  We called GE for repairs and the repairman came several days later.  He installed a new ice maker and said everthing was fine.  He turned on the water and said ""All set to go.""  When we checked a few hours later, there was no ice, the kitchen was flooding, and sheets of water were coming down from the ceiling in our rec room.  The GE repairman never turned the valve of the water line on completely, so it leaked far far worse than it ever had before.  Knowing to turn water valves completely should be Repair 101.  I called GE back at 3:15; the operator said she would e-mail an immediate request to the repair people in our area.  A taped message contacted us some five days later.  By that time we had bought a new, very different brand.
I can understand a product having problems.  But when the factory authorized repairmen make the problems far, far worse, that manufacturer should be put out of business."	0

I tried one and after a few days threw them out, and bought the maytag version. This filter does work much faster as I could tell because the water stream rate doubled. However taste is more important to me.	0
7629	By far the best solution for mounting your dishwasher under granite. Two years problem free, had to order new ones for my new dishwasher because they had a different mounting layout.	1

8623	Didn't fit my standard sink, cut it and it falls in all the time.  It was cheap, so I am ok with it.	0
24400	I don't think I have ever given a one star review for anything, so for me to rate this so poorly is telling.  This dishwasher is awful. First, the cover for the control panel fell off on top where you start the dishwasher.  The front panel is still on, but every time I wipe it off I fear it's going to dent.  It's such a flimsy piece of material that I anticipate it too will fall off at any moment.  Then there is the function:  it doesn't wash dishes!  You have to wipe down every last piece of food off the plates before you put it in the dishwasher because this unit certainly won't clean it.  It's basically a big rinse machine, there is certainly no real washing going on.  It's awful and I hate it.  Please, heed my warning:  do not buy this!  You will regret it.	0
4331	Perfect fit for my Whirlpool refrigerator for a great price.  Delicious filtered water!	1
7545	This fits perfectly. A little too perfectly. I have to take a spoon or whatever to push down extra food or water because it's soo tight. It also helps with the noise of the GD. Would buy again.	1

However, it seems over 90% of people did not have this problem (a few the reviewers did have the exact same issue), I'm giving it a second chance. Returned it and bought a second one. Will update on the new one."	0
44681	"Looks good, a pain to install, instructions suck, support sucks. The ""telescoping duct"" is not really telescoping and it's horrible, with sharp edges that will cut you.

Most importantly, though, this is definitely not for recycling air back into the room, even with filters. The flow of air it takes in is _much_ higher than the outlet hole at the top can pass through, so the air tries to escape through all other possible openings, too. Specifically, between the duct and the wall, into the electrical outlet and so on. I'm guessing condensation inside on the metal surface of the duct is going to become an issue, too.

Horrible design and a horrible implementation, stay away."	0
5644	I love it	1
6514	These break easily.  After just over one year of use both broke.  Guess how long the warranty was? Yes 1 year, guess how long GE  thinks their microwave will work before it breaks? I am guessing 1 year.  What company makes such poor quality microwaves that break after one year.	0
30021	The product is what stated. The product is inferior. After installation the part could be spun around with my fingers, should not be able to do that. Completed task anyway, the washer will only spin on light loads. What a rip off. I will have to spend the money again for the part but not from this company	0
49771	I have used WaterSentinel filters before, Model WSG-1, and I was very pleased with its performance.  But, like others have said, this WaterSentinel filter, Model WSG-4, leaks.  I corrected the problem by switching the o rings from the GE filter. I doubt that I will buy this brand again.	0
8613	These do a real good job with hard water.  Eliminates the lime taste.  We use the refrigerator water, filtered by the GE filter, all the time.	1
52321	The freezer itself is fine. The exterior however was damaged as I feared from other reviews. It looks like this was dropped from a high height and one corner was damaged completely. Nearly every side had a ding or dent. I am not happy about seeing excessive damage before fully opening the box. Looking for a refund and return now and will not buy online again...	0

4825	"I've always trusted the Electrolux name for vacuums.
When I saw that they make washers and dryers, I decided to look no further.
We've had the washer and gas dryer for about 6 months now and let me tell you I am delighted with it.
We were given a 30 day return policy, which made it more comfortable to buy and a warranty that was very good.
Nice machines, efficient, easy to use, plenty of options."	1
17785	"Worst fridge we have ever owned in 40 years. It is so loud that I can hear it buzzing all the way at the other end of the house. There's nothing wrong with it; that's just the sound it makes when operating normally. It has completely ruined the peaceful atmosphere in our home. Want to sit quietly in your living room and read a book? Impossible, because this monstrous machine is always humming and buzzing and raising everyone's blood pressure with useless noise.

The ice maker is another thing. If you have three adults in your house and they all want a tall glass of tea with ice, forget it. There will not be enough ice. If we have even a single guest over to the house we have to buy a bag of ice and get an ice chest because we know this horrible fridge will not even make enough ice for one guest.

The filter is a scam. Trying to rip people off by charging for a filter no one needs.

I bought GE because they used to be good. They have destroyed what was a great company. This fridge is garbage."	0
51013	These filters are NOT as well made as the old Pure Source ones I used to get. I haven't installed one yet but by first impression they are cheaply made, less dense, and lighter weight plastic. I wish I hadnt ordered them.	0

4864	Purchased to replace an older semi rigid hose that was dented and in need of cleaning.  Very happy with hose, feels durable and was easily installed with our old screw tightening type clamps.  No problem cutting it down to need size and our dryer seams to be working much better....less time per load.  At this price worth replacing yearly rather than cleaning out.  Will be purchasing again.	1
18986	"After three afternoons off work to visit with repairmen from two different companies, Kitchenaid informed me that there was nothing wrong with my diswasher.  Used every detergent they suggested, ran water until hot, loaded unit 10 different ways.  There is something wrong however with the product....IT DOES NOT PERFORM THE TASK IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO!!!  WASH DISHES. KItchenaid (Whirlpool) will not help at all...just sticks to the company line that there is nothing wrong with the product.  By the way, the term PowerDry that they use so loosely means heat dry in some units, but a fan that runs for 3 hours in this unit.
They are selling a piece of junk and there is no way they don't realize it.  Never paid so much for so little and had such unresponsive customer service."	0

I ordered 9 more filters.
Thank you Aquacrest."	1
5045	It's such a simple idea it's a wonder these aren't in every home improvement store.  Installation is easy (I used some clamps to hold the brackets in place so I didn't have to) and once they're installed they're nearly invisible.  Clever idea and a reasonable price.	1
14267	"Typically, the GE SmartWater Filter last roughly 6 months in my house and I had good luck with this filter until NOW.  Each of these filter lasted roughly 3 months or less.  The water could barely flow after roughly 7 weeks.

I have had good luck with ordering stuff from Amazon but had run into a couple of products that I ordered from Amazon recently that does not seem to work as good or deceptively shown (recieved product does not look like what was shown).

This is SAD because I have been a good Amazon customer.  These kind of incidents will for sure make me rethink of buying any thing through Amazon again."	0

3942	The ice maker was installed and after three days we found that it had a problem and flooded kitchen downstairs bedroom and caused extensive damage to the carpets, floors and all because of a defective unit. The unit was replaced again and no issues or problems working perfectly. Now I have damage to the home caused by the product. Who is the company and how do we get thier information as I have to file a claim against them. I would like help in getting this information in a timely manner.  Further information revealed that the unit was defective due to a microswitch which did not work properly causing the issue.	0
7405	"This is my 2nd AcuRite thermometer. The first one was smaller and worked well for several years, so when it died, I ordered this one.

At first it worked fine, accuracy was (and always has been) spot on as best I could tell, and the screen is readable with nice large numbers.

However, after about 3 months, the battery in the display died. I had put a brand new, fully charged battery in it when I first got it, so I thought that was strange, but I replaced the battery and went on. 3 weeks later it died again, but this time after replacing the battery, I couldn't get the numbers to stay visible on the screen. They would fade in and out depending on how I held the device. I finally managed to get the display to remain visible and again the unit was fine (still accurate). A few weeks later, it faded out again and it took more jiggling to get the display to come back. I even replaced the battery for a fresh one again (but the old battery tested fine and fully charged). At this point the display doesn't work at all. I can pick the unit up and if I hold it at just the right angle, I can see the numbers faintly (and they're still correct) but they don't show up on the display.

So this one is going in the trash and I guess I'll buy another brand and hope it works better"	0

5109	I ordered this dispenser because it didn't seem like the rince agent was coming out of my orginal dispenser. I ordered a new dispenser. I went to all the trouble of taking the old one out and putting the new one in and it leaked so I contacted the seller. The seller sent me a new one. I took the bad one out and put the new one in. It didn't leak but a small bottle of rince agent was being used up in two washes. At first I thought it was because of a defective dispenser but later found that my control panel had a problem. Also later I found out that you can buy detergent with rince agent in it. So, I really didn't need a new dispenser after all. $40.00 down the drain!	1

1. One year after oven install entire control panel went dark. Missed Thanksgiving in our new kitchen due to waiting for service tech appt, then ordering the part, followed by waiting for install. We went out to eat when our custom is to cook at home. Very disappointing.
2. 10 mos later error code F97, oven beeps then turns off. Timing is horrible, it's right before my daughter's birthday. So no home-baked cake OR her favorite meal. Took 21 days from my call to schedule service to part install.

36698	"So glad to have a space to record a review, in that I really wish I had been privy to them before investing in this misnomer range: professional it is not.  I really wanted a non-stainless, non-black, non-white range and was, therefore, limited in my options, esp. in the smaller size.

In the last few years, I've cooked and baked on everything from a high-end Gaggenau to a Bosch to an old advocado green GE range from the 70s.  Never have I pulled out a simple bar cookie and found a 2-3"" round burn (I'm talking charred!) spot on the bottom of the item, not coincidentally directly above the opening in the range floor (above the gas) on the right side.  Unbelievable hot spot and completly frustrating experience for an avid, and reasonably skilled, baker.  Received no customer service after various attempts.  My pan was blamed. Finally, I baked the bar cookies again, grabbed my two toddlers, strapped the infant into his carrier and trotted into the showroom of the kitchen supply company from which the range was purchased---slapping the jelly roll pan on the counter.  Took many pictures of the ruined baked good with my salesperson for forwarding to Bertazzoni.  This finally got some action on the part of the supply company.

A service technician was sent out who tinkered with the thermostat, and encouraged me to use convection, noting that most people buying the oven don't bake.  The problem was not fixed and it was clear that it would not (or could not) be.  Everyone kept saying ""Gee, we've never heard of this problem before"" and yet no one would admit that I had a lemon.  Why?  Because (I'm assuming) all Bertazzoni ranges perform in this way.  I was (and am) stuck.  Eventually a pizza stone was purchased for me to help distribute the heat. Instead, I had a ""metal guy"" make a removable disk that slips on top of this ""burn hole"" to help spare my food such intense, focused heat.  There is still plenty of air flow.  Nevertheless, I find myself baking and cooking in convection mode as much as possible.  Never having been a big convection gal, I am thankful I was forced to experiment with this.  It has baked certain things (like pies) beautifully.  However, you cannot successfully bake many things on convection (yeast breads and batter items) because of the need for the heat to come from the bottom-up (and not circulate).

As other reviewers have noted: low temperatures are almost impossible to find and hold.  Forget about meringues. Even a 300 degree cheesecake requires babying.  You simply cannot turn your oven on, enter the bake time, and walk away.

Another major problem I have had is in starting a recipe at one temperature and, after a period of time, reducing the temperature for the duration of the baking/roasting time.  I remember being none too happy to start my roast at a hot temperature, and then reduce it 50 degrees for the duration only to check on it near to dinnertime and find it ""ice cold.""  The oven simply turned off when I turned the temperature dial down. It could not discern that I had moved the dial and stopped before reaching off.  Again, I've baked on many non-digital ranges and never had such a simple (and common) action misunderstood by the range. So, for instance pate a choux type recipe would not work.  When I called Bertazzoni about this problem I was told again, ""Gee, we've never heard of this problem before.  I'll talk to my manager and get back to you.""  I was never called or otherwise contacted.

Up side: I sprang for the vintage styling in cream and it is beautiful.  The cooktop is great (except that you can't really get a low simmer setting, even with the supplied simmer plate).

Other range vendors: produce enameled/colored ranges. Not everyone wants stainless steel."	0

26204	"I bought this washer because of the large capacity.  What a mistake.  yes it can wash a large load but they just don't get clean.  It uses a small amount of water and there is no way to adjust the water level its automatic.  I watched it washing a load of sheets and the same sheet was above the water level for 3/4 of the wash time.  The cloths don't smell clean when they come out.  even small loads don't seem clean.  Ive had it for a few weeks now and i only wish i could return it to the store and get any other machine.  the cloths also seem to be getting more worn out with each wash.  I think its because the cloths are rubbing against eachother instead of being cushioned in water.  the fabreck softener is sprayed on the cloths so some spots get it and some dont.  The soak cycle is usless.  The bleach dispenser is for chlorine bleach only.  the only way to use all fabrick bleach is to throw it in the detergent dispenser.

i only gave the machine 1 star because that was the lowest, i would have rather given it none.  a 999 dollar lemon ."	0

43808	NOT a compatible replacement for UKF8001. DO NOT BUY this product to replace a UKF8001 filter. The flow rate IS NOT THE SAME and will cause problem with your refrigerator water lines. They will knock about and reduce the flow of the water. ALSO, the quantity of gallons that this filter will filter is only 2/3 of the gallons that a real UKF8001 will filter.	0
24238	Very badly designed for American families: The shelves are not spaced so that you can fit a half gallon of milk anywhere except the door, unless you eliminate one of the shelves.

57001	"We bought a Broan E6448TSS with dual centrifugal fans, and sincerely regret it. It sounds just like a helicopter taking off... next to a 150000-volt electrical transmission tower. The ELECTRICAL HUM NOISE is HUGE, and vibrates our entire house, NO MATTER WHAT SPEED is set. We thought it was the controller; but by isolating the fans, determined it is the fan motors. When we called Broan Technical Support, and said our brand-new E6448 was extremely noisy, the lady immediately responded: ""It's a VERY noisy unit!"" {So they KNOW it's a big problem!!!)

Bottom line:
It looks nice, and has:
Variable-speed fans,
Automatic heat sensor,
Three lamp receptacles (with difficult to insert lamps)...

1805	Like the simplicity of unit but the remote sensor is terrible.  I did make the effort to not put it in direct sunlight or against something that could reflect solar heat (3 different locations), but it regularly goes to 158deg during the day and stays stuck there, regardless of the outdoor temp.  Only way to reset is to yank the batteries in the base unit as well as the remote.  My old La Crosse remote is not anywhere this sensitive.  You get what you pay for I guess.	0
18266	It worked for a little more than a month during the summer, then the outside display quit working, even though it is well protected from weather and under the deck. I can't return it now. It only displays inside temp, even though I changed the batteries twice and followed the directions.	0

2218	This works great for the price and I haven't had any issues with the one that I have used to far. Keep in mind there are 4 so if one of the other three are bad I won't know for awhile. I like that they are half the price of the name brand and work the exact same. I will be buying again in two years if I still have the fridge :)	1

2712	"I love this refrigerator. I have owned it for a year and a half (with no problems). Below is my opinion based on each feature:

1. French Doors. I love them. THe left door has a flap that sort of flattens out as you close the door to seal against the right door.  Because of the little flap, the right crisper drawer does not pull all the way out if the left door is closed. Alternatively, you CAN keep the right door closed and pull the left crisper drawer all the way out. Anyhow I usually end up opening both doors when i go to the fridge, so it will take 2 hands, but i still love the french door look.

2. Inside water dispenser. Love that too. THe only bad design is the button to get the water is a few inches above the actual dispenser. it is difficult for me to get a glass of water with one hand; i usually hold the glass with one hand and press the button with the other. But i do like this design much better than the 'outside of the door' water dispenser; i think this fridge has a cleaner look. I didn't even notice the inside water dispenser at first, it takes up VERY LITTLE room which is great!

3. Drawer freezer. I like it enough for what I have (bachelorette food like hot pockets and lean cuisines). I expected it to hold a bit more than it really does. I do like the fact that it's wire baskets that hold my food rather than a solid surface; sorta eliminates cleaning.  THe reason i don't TOTALLY love this freezer is simply because if I had a bowl of liquid, i would have to be VERY CAREFUL to freeze it (such as an extra water bowl for my dog). Anything you want to be in the freezer will need to move/slide to get it in there - i have to only fill the bowl 1/2 full of water or else it will spill when i close the freezer door.

4. Adjustable ""no spill"" shelves. These are great. Everything is adjustable which is perfect for me. I adjust them quite a bit actually. Also there is a small lip on each shelf so if something leaks, it won't drip down the back wall of the fridge. I like this idea. Also the shelves pull out a few inches in case you have something in the back you need to reach.

Overall this is a great fridge. It also beeps after a few minutes if you accidently don't close a door all the way. Temperature of both the fridge and freezer are displayed at the top inside of the fridge. Very easy/intiutive to adjust. Those small flaws listed above are very easy for me to live with; i would buy this refrigerator again. And, i love the stainless steel look!"	1
9321	Very good.  Gray at first  and  then cleared up after running water thru the filter. 2 to 3 gal.	1
6132	"The hood itself works well with a well powered fan and looks good when mounted. The LED lights are very ""cool"" temperature so they display quite blue, but I have read other XtremeAir reviews that they provide warmer temp LEDs if requested. Also one the LEDs flickers constantly which I haven't been able to determine if it's the connection or the bulb.

The most annoying thing however is the fan after it is turned off.  The blades seem to be loose and rattle as they slow down. A strong wind down the chimney can also rattle the blades. Not sure if that's due to badly built motors or or just a defective unit.

Hard for me to recommend but I haven't tried many other units and for a price < $500 it's worth considering"	1
1530	Great filters, great price too.	1
512	"This compact ice maker is very nice. It is easy and intuitive to use.  The construction seems high-quality.  It gets the first batch out in about 15 minutes. This is the time for the small ice cubes.  The large ones take longer.  The ice cubes are pleasantly rounded little hollow cylinders with a ton of surface area to transfer cold quickly to chill your drink.
The ice is produced in a recessed chamber and slides out into a basket that sits over the reservoir.  If you don't use it, the water melts into the reservoir so there is always ice until you run out of water or use it all up.
The drawbacks are- you have to set it up and leave it sitting for 4 hours after you move it (this is a feature of refrigeration appliances). It doesn't have a freezer compartment to hold the ice at freezing, so it is not actually as cold as the ice out of your freezer.  It is not high volume. The basket holds about the equivalent of two trays of ice from your freezer.  However  if you are already set up and don't have the four hour wait, it takes minutes instead of hours to get that.  It is a great machine for a family or small group if you don't have an ice maker in your refrigerator.  (These families still exist) and will work for luxury ""camping"" with electricity.  If you have a small church it might be nice for the potluck- if like us people sit around and talk, and go back for another glass of tea.  It is wonderfully quiet - just a quiet hum and the clicking as the cubes tumble into the basket."	1

40126	I had been ordering these water filters with no issues but the last one I ordered didn't work. After installing it the fridge the light went to orange then red and never to green, total waste of money.	0

4073	Holes in the outer box seemed acceptable. After opening, the real damage became apparent. Sarcasm would suggest it was delivered by Airmail but without the benefit of a parachute. The freezer looked as if it had been dropped from a height .  The compressor rail was bent up about 1inch  which also bulged the right side out. I needed a freezer so decided to straighten the rail and side and plug it in. The unit has worked fine for me. The temperature is maintained at 0 degrees.with setting on midrange. The damage is not visible from the front. So as long as it remains working I will hang on to it.  4 to 5  stars for unit.  1 to 0 stars for delivery. The good reputation for returns of Amazon helped in the decision to keep the unit	1

It does wash the dishes well but it leaves residue in the skillet and pans and it doesnt dry the dishes like I thought it did but upon calling the co. I was told no it doesnt have a dryer and most dishwashers don,t because that cycle costs a lot more!	1

7998	Purchased this unit on April 30, 2016 from Amazon and placed into service two days later and it died today May 26, 2017, total days in service 389 days, unit price $191.53 including sales tax, cost per day  $0.4923.  The cost/day excludes  power and water, unit was cleaned monthly.  Other than its monthly cleaning it was never shut off.  The reason it stopped working was sensor in the storage bin.  Other than that it works great.  I believe its a good buy and will more than likely buy another.	1

Attention Whirlpool Executive Team:
As a consumer, I feel compelled to write you this letter, because I am greatly disenchanted by the lack of quality in your product. I feel nothing less that hoodwinked by your company, and as a working class mother of 3 with a husband who is a member of the United States military, I feel that Whirlpool/Maytag has taken advantage of hard working Americans. There was a time when Maytag carried an irrefutable reputation as being one of the most dependable and reliable names in the appliance business. But you are abusing this historical reputation by making expensive products that cannot match the quality of your past. I still believe in the value of the American dollar, and I think it is absurd to spend upwards of $700 on an appliance that acquires a defect  just a little after 12 months after purchase so extensive that the repairs exceed or come very close to exceeding the original cost of the unit. This is simply unacceptable. After careful research that I wish I had done first, I realize now that what I am experiencing is not uncommon for people who have purchased the exact same product as me, and in reading many consumer reviews, I see what mirrors my exact experience. If you care at all about your reputation or the consumers who got your company to the point where it is now, then you need to take heed to the words of my letter and make some changes. You tout Maytag as being reliable and dependable; you should change this deceptive marketing to one that reinforces what buying from your company is: a gamble.
In May of 2011, we purchased the Maytag Performance Series MHWE950WW 27 4.5 cu. Ft. Front-Load Washer and its matching dryer in hopes that this was an investment for years to come.  This was recommended to us by the Lowe's, the retailer from whom we purchased this product. In the words of the manager who helped us get a good deal on the Samsung that will replace the poorly functioning Maytag washer we purchased: ""Maytag's are supposed to be top of the line; this is a machine that can take anything.""  This ideology is commercial propaganda.  It is apparent that this product is assembled with poor craftsmanship, with cheap parts that are not worth the money we paid into it. The drum and bearings have gone out in a year and it takes close to 2 hours for a 50 minute load to complete. It sounds like a jet is landing in my laundry room when the spin cycle begins. I have learned that this is typical for this model. Bearings are a major component to any washer and normal wear and tear are not the cause of its failure. We used this machine appropriately, for what it is designed for, and the local repair man told me he expected more from a Maytag, and that the problem he saw in the machine was typical of a machine that was 10 years old, that it was definitely not caused by clothes being washed; this was a defect. I opted not to buy the extended warranty when we first purchased. I expected that the machine would stand the test of time.  The integrity that I assumed is a fallacy.
Notwithstanding the fact that I declined to get additional coverage, I want to focus on the fact that I did not expect that this product would fail so miserably at such a young age, considering the cost. There is no value in this product. Your response was to replace the parts and I pay the labor, which some may consider reasonable. I was initially satisfied, however after closer inspection, I realized that bearing failure and drum damage is a recurring problem on this model. So I chose to cut ties with your company and I am going the Samsung route. While I am somewhat content that at least you offered to foot the bill for these very expensive parts that have failed in a little over a year, which is in and of itself shameful, I am not willing to come up with a couple of hundred dollars each year for a recurring problem, which research shows is highly likely.  I can buy a new machine for what it will cost me to pay for the labor on a repair that is likely to occur at least 3 more times, minimally.  You should consider changing the quality of the parts that you use. You have shown me that you are nothing more than another white-collar corporate beast with an appetite of greed that profits on the backs of the hardworking, everyday, blue collar citizen, wanting more while providing less.  I could have chosen to take your free parts and pay for the labor of the repairs, but I am not so trusting of the quality of service or the dependability of your craftsmanship, so I cut my losses and invested in a Samsung.
If multiple complaints about the same malfunction keep arising, which I am certain you can assess if you choose to be honest and uphold some amount of integrity within your quality assurance department, then Maytag needs to do some serious reflection as a company. You are stealing from people who trust in the quality of your product. The quality of your product is contemptible and the cost of the products is not commensurate to what you provide.  I chose not to keep feeding the corporate beast that is Maytag, because I do not trust that the repair will ultimately fix the problem. Buying a Maytag or a Whirlpool is a gamble, not a guarantee. Period.  You should know this much.

Respectfully,

April"	0

42488	"Bought this washer in August 2015, takes way too long to wash and practically no rinse cycle (compared to prior machine) and in Dec 2015 would not move from cycle to cycle.  Started it before going to bed one night and still washing when I woke up, had to manually move the dial from cycle to cycle to finish the wash and the clothes were ruined.  Called the selling party and the authorized warranty repair companies listed on Speed Queen's website.  3 companies of the closest to my area (within 20 miles) ""do not service my area"".  Phoned Speed Queen 3 times regarding this, the call was of no value.  They told me, the customer, to call their authorized dealers and find out why they will not service the area when Speed Queen pays the service company up to a hundred mile radius drive and will ship the part needed overnight to the repair company.  When I called Speed Queen I can only speak to either sales or tech support.  Which gave me the run around and spouted the ""call the authorize service company, etc"".  Do not bother calling Speed Queen, they have no real customer service.  Still trying to find someone to fix this ""anchor"" called a washing machine.  My last Maytag machine worked for 20 years!"	0

13847	"Awful, Awful, Awful product. Electrolux should seriously be put out of business for ripping people off like this. We have had our Electrolux dishwasher since Oct. 2011 and it worked fine for about 2 to 3 months, never really getting the dishes quite as squeaky clean as our previous dishwasher that wasn;t nearly as expensive. Just like the others...Error Code 01, would just stop working/powering on, smoke coming out of the front after one repair kit was installed....
I have had to hand wash dishes for the past year and half, WITH a newborn baby and 2 year old (now 17 months and 3 years)...so for those with kids, you should know what a pain in the neck this is...all while a $1400 dishwasher sits right beside the very sink I'm standing in front of for 45 minutes washing dishes. Digusting!!
No matter what you try, this thing will never, ever get your dishes clean, I'm warning you now. Please listen and save yourself this nightmare. It will bake on old food and soap scum to where only soaking then hand washing will finally get it off. We have bought every type of dishwasher powder/tablets sold within a 40 miles radius of our home plus some from Amazon, and you guessed it.... DIRTY DISHES. I could go on and on about this thing, we are going hopefully next weekend to buy a Bosch to replace this worthless piece of junk. We're still not certain what to do with it.... Can't really sell it, guess we'll just haul it to the recycling center."	0
49844	This filter has all the correct numbers, but they have changed size of the plug that you shove into the hole. The one we bought at Walmart kid the same thing. My husband had to shave it down to get it to fit into the hole. And it leaks just a tiny bit	0
6715	"Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.

So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.

1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.
2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.
3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.
4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).
5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.
6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in."	1
11949	This is such a disappointment.

32348	"Within 4 1/2 months there were 2 casualties and GE service is TERRIBLE.

Bought in September.  In November the water/ice dispenser stopped working. It took GE 2 visits to ""fix"".  The fist visit (where I took off work) was a 15 minute diagnostic visit, then the technician ordered the part.  GE returned 10 days later to ""fix.""  Less than 2 months later the water/ice dispenser again stopped working -- that was on January 19th, it is now February 28th and it is still not fixed!  Again, the first technician spent 15 minutes to diagnose the issue and order parts.  On February 23rd -- with the parts in my house -- the GE technician refused to fix my refrigerator and in the middle of the service call he told my wife that the appointment was just cancelled.

Hope I'm as happy the second time around.
UPDATE:  I got less than 6 months out of the 2nd one.  Very expensive and sorry I bought it.  Seller referred me to the manufacturer, but it's not worth paying shipping on the bad one to get a refurb back for the balance of the one-year warranty.  I bought a different brand locally."	0

2083	This little tool is incredible.  My garbage disposal was totally broken - when I turned it on it would emit a hum, but not spin or grind anything.  I couldn't find the source of the jam even though I tried to clean it out a couple of times.  So I bought this little tool, stuck it in the hole in the bottom of the motor unit, wiggled it around for about 30 seconds, and it cleared the jam entirely.  It was easy as pie and my garbage disposal has worked perfectly ever since.  Saved me $75 calling a plumber.	1

18098	"Two years after purchasing Bosch's ""stainless"" steel ""rust-free"" dishwasher with a ""lifetime warranty"" against rust, we discovered... rust. It was in a very specific area, where the metal filter attaches to the interior tub. We called Bosch and were told that it was our fault, that it was our water, our dishwasher soap, our flatware--anything but the dishwasher. We persisted, explaining that we use a water softener and a reverse-osmosis system and that our water is no worse, and probably a bit better, than average. Furthermore, if it was merely our water, then we would expect to see rust everywhere. As for our dishwasher soap--well--it comes from Costco, and I'm sure they'd take exception to Bosch's claim that it promotes rust. We offered our own theory, which is that the metal used in the filter is disimilar to the metal in the tub, resulting in a galvanic reaction and corrosion to the metals. Basically, the two different metals, pressed together in an aqueous environment, results in a battery. But for Bosch to admit this would be to admit a design flaw--the sort of admission that leads to a class-action lawsuit. We already know Bosch uses a variety of ""stainless"" metals. For example, the metal used on the door is a very inferior grade of stainless steel that is easily streaked and spotted. And the way you can tell is to use a magnet. If the magnet sticks then it's ferrous metal and more prone to staining.

This section is taken right out of the manual: ""Stainless Steel TallTub: A rust-free, hygienic interior surface with a lifetime warranty.""

Yet Bosch claims they don't actually guarantee the tub to be rust-free; they only warrant against ""rust-through"", meaning you will have to live with the rust until it eats a hole through the metal--until water starts pouring into some part of the dishwasher where it doesn't belong (hopefully not endangering you, your family, or your home, in the process). When you consider that Bosch basically expects you to use their rusting appliance until there's a catastrophic failure, you realize that the advertisements, selling points, and sales pitches regarding ""rust-free"" and ""lifetime warranty"" are all fraudulent.

Bosch offered no remedies and suggested that the rust can be removed (on our dime, of course). The problem is that even if we use a rust-removing product, the rust will return in time, because the source of the rust--a design flaw--remains."	0

4583	"This is my third one of the same model and I refuse to get another model/brand! This is a MUST have because of how amazing it is. Yes they do break every few years but honestly the cost savings it offers is without a doubt time and time again paying for itself! I use this to do my mom's hair (which is short- goes from an ear length to shoulder length at its longest), and I also use it to do mine all the time (which goes from my shoulders to the buttocks area depending on the time & styling season/mood).

It's also amazing for thin hair (my mom) as well as thick hair (mine- although it leaves the hair pretty puffed up and frizzy but that's only when I don't care to break it down further into smaller sections).

I am no hair stylist but this is SOOOO incredibly easy to use that it's amazing at producing a salon finished hair style. I finish my hair anytime between 5 minutes (this is for everyday wear when I don't have time for a nice style and although it's still nicely curled on the bottom, it's pretty frizzy when done in larger sections) to 20 minutes (for nicely styled going out hair wear - this produces salon finished hair without a doubt and looks STUNNING! Honestly better than when I have it professionally styled and blow dried).

This is my MUST have hair care product and if I was given one product to choose to have with me in an island for a lifetime, this would be it!"	1
33771	"I have had this machine 9 months, it failed and dumped all the water under the machine and ruined my kitchen floor.
The service company said it was a failed pump/motor.
When I called KitchenAid Whirlpool to see if there was anything they could provide other than simply replacing the parts. I received a well rehearsed and scripted response that they would replace defective parts only and recommend you purchase the extended warranty.
I understand they wouldn't take care of the floor, they recommended a homeowners insurance claim. ok.
I'm thoroughly disgusted with the company response...it's just not human...but that is just the way it is with these large corporations. The individual customer is just a fly speck on the wall to be summarily dismissed.
I design kitchens for a living and have been doing so successfully for 25 years. Since my experience with KitchenAid is as described above I will no longer recommend this brand to my customers. That's it! Done!"	0
17009	"What a waste of money. This machine never worked right, but after 2 years started noticing that the clothes were wet at the end of the cycle. Then the timer would jump from 20 minutes left in the cycle back to 42 minutes left, then back down and back up several times. We had a repairman out who said the computer was going out, which was $400-$500 to repair. Now the machine is not spinning at all, leaving the clothes wringing wet. Will be buying a new washing machine tomorrow. GE has lost a customer - I agree with other reviewers and suggest NEVER buying GE appliances. Their ""customer service"" is non-existent,"	0

8690	Unit is poorly constructed, very flimsy.  First unit I bought worked for 3 days.  (Two uses per day.)  Amazon replaced it because I thought it was just a fluke.  Second unit lasted about 3 weeks with no more that 2 uses per day.  I do NOT recommend this item!	0

The door of this range gets EXTREMELY hot when in use. Whirlpool has no solution for this and had absolutely no compassion other than to send out a technician and charge for a service where the result is - well that's just how the range works!

18479	"Bought this fridge. After 18 months it stopped cooling. Judging from the appalling number of atrocious reviews, I'm not the only one this has happened to. Too bad the warranty covers parts-only. I sure could use some labor assistance, here since the fridge has decided to enter the malfunction zone. After testing the simple stuff, and reading there are large numbers of recurring compressor failures, I just threw my $2000+ fridge away and bought a new one. DISPOSABLE FRIDGE! Based on what I heard online, it's not even worth trying to repair these things. Sounds like a total nightmare. I just blew threw money, and LG blew threw all my goodwill. I am disgusted by this failure of a refrigerator! Oh my gosh!

The actual features of the fridge are fine. It makes very nice crushed ice. It has a lot of space. And, it breaks."	0
5784	Received the product with a broken drip pan. It had ripped out from underneath and broke in shipping. Reached out to Whynter support and within 48 hours they had me a new one on the way!

5820	"I had this machine for 5 years. I am rarely home and use it at the most once a week. It broke several times. Other companies give similar appliances several years warranties, but Fisher and Paykel only one. Customer service is unfriendly. If you need a repair you need to get a report from a third party first.

Overall unreliable product and terrible customer service.

I would have given Zero stars if I could"	0
32226	"I bought this machine not from amazon, but from Sears Canada. I live in Toronto.
After 2 weeks' usage, the machine died with ""F43"" error indicating ""motor malfunction"". I called the repairing service. It took over 1 month and 3 visits to make it work again. For this request, they first ordered a motor, and then found the problem was not on the motor. Then they ordered a control unit, and after they replaced this unit, the washer ran again.
But it was only good for less than 2 weeks. This time there is no error code, and timer decrements. But the motor is not moving. So I have to call Sears again.
It is hard to imagine a brand new washer broke twice within the first 3 months. The time that I wait for repairing is even longer than the time I am able to use it.
Besides the horrible reliability, the user manual is poorly written. The letters are small, and and the figures are hard to understand. There are ""go to page xx"" everywhere.
I always want to show due respect to Germany engineering, but it turns out they are dumping garbage to North American market."	0
53399	Delivery via Amazon prime was great. The range hood is very stylish and modern. We finally got to install this unit during our house renovation. It was vibrating a lot when the installation was complete. I called the seller, who asked me to write him an email about the problem which I did but never got a reply of. After writing a second email today, I am regretfully taking the range hood down and initiating return. Disappointed at a product which I initially bought reading about great customer service and feedback.	0

So, I will pay $55 for the OEM product and let you know if that corrects the problem.

The plastic smell and taste is gone which to me confirms it was this replacement filter.  I recommend that you buy the new Maytag ""Ice and Water"" filter linked above because the old ones are no longer manufactured which is likely why some sellers are charging double the price."	0
14707	I was very disappointed that I wound up getting a lemon. The compressor lasted less than 2 years. The repair person was in disbelief and said he would not hesitate to buy another of the same model (he has the same one). He did indicate it was a fluke, but obviously there is a quality issue. I did buy another of the same model, solely because all of our appliances where bought the same time Microwave, Oven, Dishwasher and Refrigerator and all matched. I pray that this lasts longer. I did not get the extended warranty, primarily because being short on cash, I had to make a decision. None the less, I have the new one, the old one I ravaged out parts and it was removed. It is too bad they can't stand behind the product more and warranty the compressors longer (kind of like transmissions in cars).	0

5148	My wife and I moved into a townhouse recently that had a lousy GE washing machine. We replaced it a couple of weeks ago with the Maytag Bravos MVWB850YG. What a great washing machine! It handles everything from super delicates to large comforters perfectly. Highly recommended.	1

20145	"I bought this to try to cheap out on the $40 filters for my Samsung fridge. I figured at half the price this ought to be worth a shot. Wrong. To start with I had to remove the top shelf in the fridge to be able to install this since it is a taller unit than the samsung filters. The shelf fits fine once installed btw. But what really makes this thing get only 1 star is the fact the the water just tastes terrible. TERRIBLE. I don't know if it just doesn't filter or the filter material makes the water taste bad but it is awful. I lived with it for a month to see if it got better but last night I finally had it and took it out. I tried to save $20 but I might as well have tore up a $20 bill instead of wasting it on this.

It was worth a shot, but maybe I can save you $20."	0
49755	"I never place reviews (and I am no fan of GE anymore), but I couldn't help myself in this case. The old line ""you get what you pay for"" rings true with these generic filters. I bought these to replace the GE brand that was long overdue, but after flushing out 4-5 gallons it literally tasted like it was straight out of the tap. I thought I was imagining things, so I put the old GE filter back and immediately noticed the difference. The GE's are way overpriced, but there's a reason why."	0

2560	I tried to order this part from Samsung.  They told me I would have to call a technician.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.

48280	"My husband & I just recently got this dishwasher and based on other reviews, we will keep our fingers crossed that it performs the same months from now.  Currently, we love it!  It cleans dishes so much better than our previous dishwasher...but probably because it's an upgrade from what we had before.  We have yet to re-wash a dish & no spots on anything.  Our previous dishwasher left so much food residue on the dishes that I was constantly re-washing in the machine (don't know why) or hand washing.  We don't mind that the cycles take a bit longer either because it's not like we are going to use the dishes right away.  I LOVE that it's quiet, which is another upgrade from our last machine.  That thing was so noisy!  I think it has plenty of room for all kinds of dishes, and we put everything in it.  One reviewer mentioned something about bowls, but we've put bowls of every size in it.  I have no bad things to say about this appliance yet.

Update:  As of 10/11/11 we pretty much don't like this dishwasher anymore.  We were SO hopeful too!  At this point I wouldn't say it's the worst dishwasher ever, but you definitely can't overpack it (that's probably for any dishwasher though, right?  maybe?).  Anyway, there must be something up with the detergent dispenser because soap went all over a Pyrex dish that we had in there and hand washing that dish wouldn't even get the soap off!  It's like it doesn't come out right anymore and just leaves a detergent trail down the inside door of the washer.  Most of the dishes do come clean, but now (even with Jet Dry or something similar) some of the glasses come out looking really cloudy.  I have had to re-wash some dishes before or just hand wash them which is highly disappointing.  I guess the only good things I can say about it still is how quiet it is and I like the child lock, which our previous washer didn't have.  *The only thing about the child lock is...it doesn't prevent your child from turning the washer on.  Our son has hit a cycle button before and as long as the dishwasher is completely shut the cycle will start after a few seconds.  So, we have to make sure he turns it off if he turns it on."	0

We gave it two weeks to settle in and they told us that ""outside of our return period you will need to work with the manufacturer for assistance under their warranty"".  Selling faulty units or poor quality products. I'll make sure to steer clear of this vendor in the future!"	0
1232	"This product claimed that it would fit our refrigerator and it appears to fit in correctly, but the taste of the water was disgusting. Our original (non knock-off filter) was awesome and the water tasted great. After the filter expired and while we were waiting for our new filters to arrive, we started drinking water from that tap. It was ok..not as great as before, but nothing compared to what the water tasted like after installing this filter. It made the water taste like metal and we were absolutely not satisfied. We tried running several glasses of water through it hoping to flush it out, but nothing helped. We eventually had to replace it with a different filter which worked perfectly.

Maybe, I received a defective/mismatched set.  Luckily, the dryer installer had a spare set of tension clamps on his truck that he provided for free.."	0

19666	Yes, mine went to junk almost immediately, but here's a tip that might help. Go to your accompanying GE washing machine and you'll find the load size knob is the same knob. Before you switch it, fill the three side recesses of back of the the knob with glue or filler. Let it dry, then use the washer knob between the two. (I rarely change load size so mine is mostly on the dryer.)	0

80	If you don't have the space or money for a washer and dryer this is the unit for you.  After about a year of heavy use I'm still amazed at how well it performs!  The spin cycle gets many items nearly dry so time on the line is minimal.  If it had a better lint removal system I could easily give it 5 stars but the cartridge often falls off in the wash and is basically ineffective even when in place.  I use a floating lint skimmer  (very inexpensive via Amazon) which collects the lint the machine misses during the wash cycle.	1

3525	water pressure shoots out pretty hard at first and causes a splash. Other than that, the water taste good and does not have any funny smells. I will see if they last as long as the LG filters. My LG filter lasted 1.5 years and the water always tasted great	1
9782	It works. But flows about about a 1/4 of the speed of the factory PUR replacement. This was my first purchase of this brand filter and disappointed. It literally takes a minute to fill a 16 oz glass.  My last filter would fill up the same glass in about 15 secs. I know I am being extreme but try filling up a 60 oz kuerig coffee container.

39600	Possible fake.  I had bought a 2 pack, the water was not coming out as fast as usual, eventually came to a trickle.  Became annoying just to fill my coffee pot in the morning.  I took it out and put the other one.  Same thing.  Eventually bought directly from manufacturer and presto, water now comes out like it should.  I'm glad I paid the few extra dollars as I had done an internet search and after confirming the water supply hose the fridge was working, the next step was to have a new pump installed in the fridge.  Turns out that it had nothing to do with the fridge, but likely the filter itself.  I think it all depends on the vendor, as I had purchased one earlier without any problems, so roll the dice with your money, if you want.	0

5458	I should have listened to the other reviews before committing to a 2 pack.  The water tastes pretty terrible.  I'm hoping it gets better after the initial switch, but I'm not holding my breath.  After-taste is the worst part of the overall craptastic experience for me. You've been warned...	0
55047	"I can't comment on the dual fuel aspect; all i can say is i hate our electric model.  It takes 20minutes for a moderate size pot of water to boil.  Ridiculous.  The burners constantly cycle, it's horrible.
My wife fell in love with the olde style look (not this one) and she totally regrets it.  I regret it not only for the poor function but the 2x price and the custom install i had to perform - now i'm stuck with this odd width.
I hope i help someone think twice about their purchase."	0
39469	I had been buying  a different brand filter but thought that the price was a little bit high so I went shopping around on Amazon for a different brand that might work and be a little cheaper.  The previous brand had been selling for almost $25.  I bought this one for a little over $17.  I only bought one because I wanted to make sure that it worked right.  It came, it fit, it seems to work fine in my Whirlpool side by side.  So I went back to order more and the price had gone up over $3 in less than a week.  I went ahead and ordered 1 more, but the price shifting thing really ticks me off.  Makes me feel like the price hike is done on purpose when I buy it.	0
8329	"This did not officially ""fit"" my GE dishwasher according to the internet/website logic but it worked great. Clearly the solenoid element was the same as the [broken] one I removed from my dishwasher and I just needed a pluming brass ""elbow"" which incedentally came with the (separeate) feed hose I bought to replace my frost-damaged one. the threaded attachments on the steel housing didn't work with the old screws from the original but I just used some small zipties ( you could use any old small bolts and nuts as well) and it worked. Point is, if your compoents look like this, buy this part, figure out how to install it and it will make your washer work great!"	1

1418	"Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.

So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.

1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.
2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.
3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.
4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).
5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.
6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in."	1

56822	This is supposed to be two parts, a pan and a trim ring which will fit my stove. It is a single piece steel stamping that DOES NOT FIT. I asked about a return, but I'm supposed to pay return shipping, which is more than the thing is worth. Added to the recycling bin. More cheap Chinese crap along with deception. Don't waste your money.	0
2683	Equal quality to the original part.  Size and tension work perfectly.  No problems with the installation or with the functioning after installation.	1
48555	I bought this product to help reduce or eliminate the white dust caused by my ultrasonic humidifier.  It is also supposed to help prevent buildup on the inner workings of the unit.  I can't speak for the inside of the unit, but I can truly say it did not help with the white dust issue at all.  I will either have to use distilled water or buy a new humidifier.	0
5032	"This is the second Water Sentinel Filter we have ordered and they are very good and exactly like the ""name brand"" ones that cost twice as much! Thank you for your good service"	1
1144	very happy with this product, the original one in my kitchen was shot and caked with grease and food. This fit right in and was very easy to install. Looks great and about half the price of similar Range hoods at HD and Lowes.	1
46452	I bought this about 6 weeks ago.  Installation wasn't an issue; it was a little weird that the instructions didn't suggest running a couple gallons of water through it and discarding before using for drinking purposes (I've never had a fridge filter that didn't suggest doing that).  I did it, anyway, which is probably a good idea as there were some noticeable particles (carbon?) at the beginning.  But, starting last week I now seem to get intermittent leaking from the filter.  I've removed and reconnected it, and it still happens every few days.  I assume maybe they had to make some sacrifices in order to make this suitable as a replacement for so many different Bosch filters.  So much for saving $15-20 on each filter - I'm going back to the Bosch ones.	0
8881	I needed these--they're great for keeping the kitchen clean.  I slapped them on right away.  My fridge thanks me for keeping it warm for the winter--I'm kidding.  They are not only good for easy maintenance due to the ability to wash them, but opening the refrigerator door is more pleasant in the winter!  Why did I not get these sooner?  I hope they come in other fabrics.  There are some with three doors--french style and those would be a great gift for my mother!	1

8521	"Got this mainly to replace a hose. Thought I would try an alternative since this device lets me push my dryer back closer to the wall. Installation was not exactly easy and required a good amount of aluminum duct tape, but here's what I had to do:
Completely remove my washer and dryer out of the room (my laundry room is small and tightly packed). Then I had to size the vent from my dryer to the outside vent hole. I had to cut the excess aluminum off with some snips. I also used a pair of scissors, as it made some cutting angles easier. The parts I cut were extremely sharp.
I then almost completely wrapped the vent in aluminum duct tape to cover all the holes and gaps so no air could leak through. Since it's adjustable and slides, it has a lot of cracks and gaps that was needed to be filled. I even taped the cracks in the vent holes, which did prevent them from rotating, but I wasn't bothered by that. I just wanted no hot dryer air to leak out at all.
I then connect the vent to the outside vent hole, then with some help, slid the dryer into place while lining the vent holes up. All done!

One problem with this vent, as opposed to a hose, is that you can't move the dryer around once you set it in place. If you do, you may disconnect the vent, which, in my case, means moving our washing machine out to be able to reach the vent connections again.
Another problem is that I had to use a lot of aluminum tape to properly seal it, which was tedious. But no air is leaking out and our laundry room doesn't get hot at all anymore!

I definitely recommend this if you want to be able to push your dryer back as close to the wall as you can (2 to 3 inches for me). But if you aren't concerned with needed extra space, I'd stick with a regular duct hose. It's much more hassle free and easy."	1

25200	Product was correct part but it LITERALLY fell apart during normal installation.  In looking at the old part and comparing, I see that this replacement part was not glued together as was the old one.  Worse than a waste of time, I waited for 3 days for delivery and piled up the household's clothes.  Then, I decided to bypass the switch by cutting the wires and securing them together with a wire nut a tape.  Dryer works but does not shut off when door is opened.  No big deal since I don't have a toddler.  PROBLEM SOLVED FOR FREE.	0

Electrolux customer service is horrible and their :warranty"" is a repair warranty they won't replace an appliance until it is deemed un-repairable no matter how long it takes =- BEWARE.

6245	The two wire nuts in the picture are actually made of ceramic. I did not know this. Both the nuts came broke and I had to find them elsewhere. The nuts are very fragile and you can't buy them at your local Wallie World. It makes sense that the nuts are ceramic because plastic will melt in your range.  The manufacturer should have packaged it better.  Perhaps putting the wire nuts in a bubble pack.	0
35273	"Good:
-Relatively easy to assemble
-provides a CO2 canister

Bad:
-Metal siding feels cheap and loose
-the tap at the top of the kegerator is loose and flimsy. It feels cheap...almost like it will break after a few uses.
-keg does not sit properly inside the kegerator for some strange reason and does not allow the door to fully close. In other words...the kegerator does not do a very good job of keeping a keg closed (which to me is the main purpose of a kegerator)

Overall, this product is a huge (and expensive) disappointment. I advise looking at other products."	0

2778	Well made rubber hoses. Color coding was helpful to me flushing my tankless water heater with them. Price is great. Made in USA! These are leak free and well made.  Like another reviewer stated I wouldn't use anything but stainless sheathed hoses on my washer. Did you know your supposed to turn off the water to a washer when ever it's not in use? The hoses can burst and flood your home. I'm lazy. I only turn it off on vacation and hope stainless sheathed hoses keep me safe.	1
53474	"After reading the reviews and deciding to purchase it anyway, I really wish I listened to all the warnings.  After purchasing this on Dec. 15, 2015, BOTH round/cylinder pieces broke off almost eleven months to the day. There are only two of us in the household (and one was ten years old at the time of purchase), I cannot imagine that the two of us managed to dirty so many glasses and dishes over the course of less than a year that the same part broke again (and worse).

I decided to listen to the reviews and purchase the suggested replacement, which is to arrive today.  I hope I have much better luck this time."	0
41374	"Either the dryer lint assembly or lint filter was poorly designed since this filter leaves an air gap that lets lint through into the lint assembly and ductwork.  On top of that, the filter also did not fit as snug as the original.

Allowing needless lint to be allowed through the lint assembly increases the chance of a fire hazard.

A lint filter is only as good as it fits.  Watch for gaps and needless lint being sprayed into the outdoors.
( I deep clean the dryer once a year, and have a professional clean the ductwork every 2 years.  And the amount of lint that makes it through is an absolute joke. )"	0

1510	While I don't use my oven daily, I do use it for a fair amount of baking so temperature control is important.  While I had to replace the control panel once already, I noticed recently when trying to bake small cakes that the temperature (based on a separate thermometer I had put in the oven once it seemed that things were not baking evenly) ranges 35 degrees above or below the set temperature.  Tired of messing with it - at this price the oven should be dependable.  Will not use GE Profile again.	0
43137	When I placed this item in the freezer it wouldn't stick to the side of the freezer as it should.  But I expected  that from reading the previous reviews and it wasn't that big of a deal.

5415	"Excellent product. The washer still vibrates, but at a smaller range. It used to vibrate/shake excessively at all speeds above LOW. And if you put in more than two pairs of jeans, the washer would walk a few inches and bang into the dryer.
After trying to level it, then laser levelling it, then taking it off the pedastals (to lower it's Center of Gravity), nothing really helped the situation.
After reading the reviews from this site and from multiple other sites, I ordered the product. I installed these feet in two minutes and ran a load of towels on MAX rinse/spin level and it worked great. Like I said, it vibrates still, but it no longer shakes the neighborhood and no longer sounds like a box of screws broke open inside the washer (and yes, I removed all the shipping bolts and other ""ways to help"" that many other people mentioned).
It is much quieter and tolerable than before the feet. The washer stays put and the feet absorb the shaking quite well."	1

Used the filter in place for a week and ran the water in the door and allowed it to refill the freezer ice tray.  However, the flow rate was still significantly reduced and unacceptably slow.

477	"Love this dryer!  I also own the Panda washer (see separate review) and used to hang my clothes on a hamper after washing, but with this dryer, the clothes are dried a lot quicker and wrinkle free in most cases.  I can't believe how hot this gets at only 100v, but it holds a good capacity of clothes and performs exceedingly well.  Right now it's winter and I have it vented into a water bowl indoors I purchased for this task, but come summer, I will have to vent outdoors as it reaches 100 degrees where I live.  There is a smaller model, but I chose the larger one.  I will update in another six months.

Product Update 9/2016 - Still going strong!  I did have a problem with the machine not turning on, but I opened the back cover and jiggled a few wires.  That was 4 months ago and it's been running fine since and saving me lots of coins for almost 2 years now. In fact, it paid itself off a long time ago, so what's there to complain about?  I did create an outdoor vent through a sliding door window, and now there's no indoor humidity or added summer heat whenever I dry my clothes.  I bought an extra set of filters and each one lasts a long time.  As for the main filter assembly, no need to keep disassembling it, just vacuum the lint out of both sides with a pointed vacuum nozzle.  One last thing, never put soaking wet clothes in your dryer, you'll burn out the bearings and place unnecessary wear on the belt.  Spin dry your clothes first, then toss them into the dryer."	1

I finally gave up and went back to tried and true method of using old doors as a template and marking mortise outlines with the old doors.  Got my doors hung and they're fine.

I'll try and put this thing craigslist one of these days, it's in storage brand new."	0
47662	DO NOT BUY. This is a late review. Bought one for my PSS27NGPA in 11-2014. After install, my Expressthaw never worked again. The following year, my ice dispenser started working intermittently, followed by the water. I've been buying bottled water for 3mo now. Finally, both the fridge and freezer stopped cooling Friday, and I had to throw out $200 in organic meats because the temp hit 62 by Monday. I just bought a replacement board from GE yesterday, explained my situation, and they discounted their board to $50 + overnight shipping. After installing today, everything works again. You can see the burnt capacitors in the attached pic. Do not buy, stick to a GE board.	0

8796	Our supposedly high-end dishwasher broke just after its warranty expired, so I wasn't willing to shell out big bucks for another. Not to mention, if you read their reviews on the big box store sites, they all seem bad! Amazon had the best prices, so we took a chance on this one, and are glad we did. Fairly easy install, the parts we needed, we just took off the old dishwasher, and we were good to go. Yes, it doesn't dry, which is...uncommon. But, it washes the dishes and silverware just as good as any other! We just tilt the door open a bit after it beeps to signal that it's done, and the dishes dry the natural way (door doesn't fall all the open either, which is nice). Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone with a small kitchen looking for a solid budget dishwasher!	1

27	So, my 1997 Kenmore (model 106.546002300) decided to have the ice maker break for the second time since purchase.  The first failure was in 2007 (10yrs) and I purchased the replacement from Sears for $165.  When I checked Sears to replace upon this most recent failure (9yrs) the cost was $234.99 (ouch - it would be more practical to replace the refrigerator).  Since I had the ice maker model# I thought I would check Amazon - ha $86!!!  It arrived and I put it in and viola I have ice again - hurray!!!	1

1900	"This thing is the bomb.  I didn't purchase it through Amazon, but rather bought it at a local appliance store after reading the reviews.

As stated, there are no computer panels, no fancy controls, no ""steam"" option or any of the other 40,000 things my old front-loader did.  This machine does nothing except clean your clothes really well.

I had two front loading machines prior to this, and hated both of them.  If I didn't leave the door open, the mold smell appeared within a day.  The rubber gasket around the door - on both machines - wore out after a few years.  And it would take - no exaggeration - over an hour for a simple load of clothes.  I think that because this machine fills with water (like the old fashioned ones our mothers used) it gets clothes cleaner.  It's that simple.

Very, very happy with this purchase."	1

42094	With all three of these filters, when removing them, the end that plugs into the refrigerator came off of the filter and lodged itself into the fridge which allowed for water to shoot out of the hole in the plug and with no filter attached to catch it, soaked everything inside and out, including a very pregnant me who was caught off guard the first time around. I was stuck having to hold the filter in place to stop the water spout and thought I might be stuck there for hours until my husband returned from work. I finally just had to bite the bullet and let the water pour out while I ran outside to shut off our main water line. (Of course, we did this first the next two times we changed these things out.) In order to get the stuck plug out, we have to use a wire hanger to reach all the way to the back of the fridge and pry it out. While in place, the filters seemed to work fine but the savings was really not worth the hassle to change them out.	0

8768	This is my impression after running with the pads for about a month. They look the same but are just simply not as effective in getting water into the air as the real ones.  I have the aprilaire 400 series. The way these work is that there is a reservoir of water at the bottom. Water flows down through the pad from the top to the bottom periodically  to refill the reservoir.  The key to the whole system working is the ability of the pads to wick the water  up from the reservoir and into the pad where it can be evaporated into the air.  With the manufacturer pad I get at 20-30% humidity readings when the heat is running.  Since I switched to these to save some money I'm never higher than 16%	0

Did not contact seller; just very disappointed and will try another seller to see if i can get a better part.	0
39019	I thought the description was too good to be true, and I was right. Shame on me. Mounting was straightforward and easy, and it is fairly heavy gauge stainless, but I have to remove the filters to get it to pull anything closely resembling enough air to get the most basic ventilation, and I have it vented directly outside through the wall at the top of the hood, with only one elbow..

6383	This 6 hour timer is a replacement for the timer that failed on my 20 year old sub zero 532. My freezer was icing up and not defrosting, making ice maker not work and also not getting to sub zero temps. After researching the internet I troubleshooted by advancing back wheel on existing timer till it clicked. Once i saw in 30 minutes that no defrosting had taken place I ordered this new one. Shipped extremely fast! Probably because I live in same state as company, CA. Simple to replace. Directions were quite easy to follow. Connected the weird extra wire to number one. This makes it continuous application. took a half hour for the defrost to start then a couple days for my freezer to finally get back to 0 degrees.

5807	"The outdoor sensor is really slow. It must not transmit to often. It takes forever for the outside reading to get to the actual temperature. When and if it does stabilize, it is off by at least 2-4+ degrees. The indoor temp is very accurate. But no tenths of a degree. Humidity readings are pretty close for indoors and outdoors. I own a lot of thermometers. The most accurate is a wired probe for outdoor temp that does tenths of a degree. They show live readings with no delay.
Do not expose the remote sensor to rain. It should be mounted in a shaded area where it won't get wet from rain. I had this sensor mounted where I thought the rain would not get to it. I was wrong. It got wet from a hard rain today and stopped transmitting. Took it inside and dried it out. It came back to life. Even the manual says to mount dry shady area at least 6ft off the ground.
I will probably return it. I already got one of these to replace it and it surprisingly accurate within .08 - 1.0 degrees. It has a big colorful very large backlit display. The outdoor sensor reacts fast.

I now have a $2500 double oven/microwave unit and the microwave is so pathetically under powered it won't pop popcorn.

WON'T. POP. POPCORN. BECAUSE. IT'S. UNDER. POWERED. HOW?!?

Kitchen Aid gives you a special metal tray to put the popcorn on...and it still doesn't work. a single serve bag, 3 and a 1/2 minutes later is half burned and half unpopped. It's incredible how awful this thing is. And the convection oven? Baked goods are still uneven. And the timing is not reduced by using that feature.

As god as my witness I will never buy another Kitchen Aid product again, and then I'll never be hungry again, either.

We also bought a kitchen aid dishwasher. it takes hours to run and stuff isn't that clean."	0
10796	I saw mixed reviews on this item And I decided to take a chance. Definitely not worth it. My water tastes very bad. Not much different than what comes out of the tap.

13047	I bought this appliance based on the reviews. The knobs have broken twice now, and the blue light under one knob does not turn off. Even worse is dealing with GE customer service and getting someone to come out and do repairs when it is under warranty. The first time a know broke the repair occurred, but only after about 6 to 10 phone calls. I just spend another 40 minutes today on one call (the second today) for the second knob repair. Customer service is polite but the work does not get done. Massive confusion about whether they will send me the part, or whether they have done so. Really a mess. I would not purchase a GE appliance again, but others may have had better experiences than I. There are too many choices out there for a customer to deal with such a cumbersome customer service department.	0
47631	"I bought a twin pack of these and at first everything was just fine but after I noticed that the water in the door was flowing more slowly. Then it kept slowing down... a lot.  After about 2 months of use it is now so slow it would take about three minutes to fill a glass of water.

I replaced the filter with the 2nd filter purchased and the flow is back to normal (15-25 seconds to fill a glass).

After checking the filters and packaging I can find no company contact information.  I googled them and can find nothing and since I am now past the 30 day Amazon return period I have no way of getting a refund or replacement.  It is very disappointing that in today's world a company has no website or contact information available on the web (there is another EcoAqua but doesn't appear to be the same company - different logo, different products).  Very shady.

The best that I can say about the filters is that they are cheap.  I guess you get what you pay for.  We will see if second filter  lasts any longer than the first,  but I I'll avoid this brand in the future and can't recommend them at all."	0

47361	"They need to change the name of the company to KitchenJunk. I do not use the convection oven for routine cooking, therefore, in the first four years of ownership, I only cooked 2 turkeys on two Thanksgivings. That's it, total. I used the self-clean function the first time, no problem. The second time? The self-clean function destroyed (burned up) the hinges to the tune of a several hundred dollar repair. So, I never used the oven again and now, it doesn't work at all! Motherboard is burned out. Microwave still works.

KitchenJunk needs to be put out of business. My repairman said he can't get a tech on the phone (they just don't answer) and when he does, no one really knows what they're talking about. I will never buy this brand again."	0

33618	"Terrible product.

I won't cool below 50F which is unacceptable for beer and soft drinks, which was my intended use.
This is a wine cooler disguised as a beverage cooler.

I did not do the procedure to adjust the thermostat, since that would probably void warranty. It is not in the manual, so I didn't risk it.

Just when I thought I would have to find a different use for this cooler, the temperatures started dropping, but they dropped too low. The thermostat was defective and I had it repaired under warranty. Haier's support was bad and the recommended repair shop took months to get the issue resolved.

Now the unit is back from repair and it's back at 50F, not cold enough for my beers.

I regret buying this, it's noisy, not cold enough, terrible support. I would sell it for 30 bucks if I found a buyer."	0

6621	"My GE refrig and the built-in ice maker requires these filters.  Went to my local big box retailer looking for a replacement and went into sticker shock when I saw the price of an OEM filter.  Not buying that noise, so I looked further.  Found a house brand that was just shy of 2 for the price of 1, which was better, but there had to be room for improvement.

One year later, it was filter time once again and I had gone though my two pack.  That lead me here.  A 3 pack on lightning special.  Bought them and installed the first a couple months ago.  Like the big box filter, fit like a glove.  No leaks, little residue when purging the filter of air.  A good replacement at a more reasonable price.

I have not had my refrig water tested to see if their filtration claims are accurate, but I have not seen any issues with these filters.

The cost of an OEM filter is absolutely ridiculous.  These filters work just as well as the OEM ones do.  Unless I am really missing something, I will repurchase more when I go through the other two filters in the next year or so.  I can recommend them to you.  They just work.

5192	"We bought this refrigerator in August of 2014.  The water dispenser/computer board did not work properly from the beginning.  It is supposed to measure your water - the screen just said 0oz as it filled my cup.  The hot water dispenser did not work at all.  The ice maker made ice that did not freeze properly and therefore did not come out when you use the ice dispenser on the front door.  After several service calls it was determined that the computer board was the issue.  There were no boards available throughout the company so after pressing the issue, GE replaced our original refrigerator.

The GE delivery team refused to hook up our water to the new refrigerator so it was impossible to know if the problem we had with the first one was solved with this new refrigerator.  After a few days the new refrigerator made a loud noise.  More service appointments and a new fan for the deli drawer and the noise persisted.  Luckily the very nice service guy agreed to hook up our water (apparently company policy is not to touch copper pipes).  The water features worked great. Finally. But the refrigerator is now freezing in some areas. This refrigerator is supposed to prevent freezing in the upper part due to its advanced dual cooling system.  Not so. Frozen eggs, carrots, yogurt and juice.

Following week the refrigerator stopped cooling on a Friday morning.  Temperature went to 57. Earliest appointment GE could offer was Wednesday of the following week.  After several long phone calls we were promised $125 to go buy a dorm sized refrigerator in the interim.  I have a 1 month old, $3000 refrigerator standing empty and am feeding a family of 5 from a dorm sized refrigerator. Not impossible but frustrating.

Monday morning the refrigerator starts working again on its own. Tech comes out Wednesday and can see from the computer that it went to 57 for three days. He cannot tell for sure what is wrong because its working again. Orders a new fan thinking that may be the problem.

Following Saturday the refrigerator again stops cooling and goes to 56 degrees. As I write this Monday afternoon the refrigerator is still not cooling.

GE's warranty is repair or replace - so buyer beware. GE is refusing to refund my money for this appliance that is unreliable and costing me hours of time and $$$ in spoiled food.  After multiple phone calls and requesting to speak to a supervisor, they have now offered a replacement upgrade.  Not sure I can trust this company and will continue to press for a refund."	0

I contacted the manufacturer and was told that Amazon is NOT AN AUTHORIZED DEALER and the appliances sold through the various sellers at amazon would not be covered. They ""did me a favor"" and ""repaired"" the appliance after making me ship the whole thing to them at my expense. It seemed to work for all of 3 weeks and is now fully broken AGAIN. The blue light comes on but no bubbles. My water is of god quality and filtered. This was a complete waste of my money. I am not sending this thing back again just to have it work for less than 3 weeks. My advice, don't waste your money."	0

6423	"It is the exact item I needed at the best price I found, and I shoulda got two at that price.
BTW, since this item is what I expected, I'd normally give it 3 stars, but since it was a better than average price, and arrive quickly I added one more.

Notice when I say shoulda got more, I mean to buy multiple SINGLE packs.  Notice 3 single packs ($29.47 * 3) costs $88.41, but the three pack (where they get to save shipping by using a single shipping container) costs $92.90 ($4.49 more).

Reminds me of the joke where the Three Stooges sell cups of lemonade for $0.25 each, or 3 for a dollar."	1

11655	"This freezer can be purchased for much less at Sam's Club, but you might want to reconsider your purchase.  When there is a power outage-- thunder storm, electrician working at the box, etc. -- you must manually unplug the freezer, wait a minute, and plug it back in.  There is no automatic restart, even though the green light is on.  The motor is very quiet, so you'll need to get down near the floor to even hear if it has come back on.

So, if you don't mind losing some lightweight things like fruit and veg, you might be able to go away for 24 hours without losing too much food.  Otherwise, stay home and check for freezing every day.

Believe me, I will get it in writing the next time...  This is NOT a good feature."	0

3229	An elderly friend complained that his icemaker wasn't working. He had paid a repairman $200 for a housecall that determined a part was needed and that the $200 could be used toward the actual repair once the part came in.  After taking a look at the icemaker bin and the parts I thought, what the heck, I'll give this a try.  After disassembling the bin (6 screws) and taking the actuator rod and spring off (1-screw) and removing the 2 screws in the bin, the auger/grinder easily came out. It was clear that the drum was broken (the vanes had broken from the center) but what wasn't clear was that the drum was a separate piece from the auger. It appeared to be one piece and I was convinced I was looking for a one-piece auger/drum.  I thought this separate drum was not the correct part. I went on Youtube and found a repair video (very helpful!!) for this particular piece only then clearly saw that there was a cir-clip, washer, and nylon nut that held every together and that the drum comes off separately from the auger shaft.  I didn't actually take the old drum center off until the replacement came in but rather put it all back together so I wouldn't lose anything. Once the part came in it took about 15 minutes to replace since I'd done it all before. The auger didn't turn/spin as easily as I thought it should (it feels just a bit too snug), but it dispenses cubes and crushed ice just fine. And as a previous reviewer stated, this part seems much more robust that the one it replaces.	1

25858	Loved my Frigidaire for about a year and a half. Now I hate it. Refrigerator stopped working, after the one year (what-a-joke) warranty wore out. The refrigerator is less than two years old. How does it stop working in less than two years? We had an old refrigerator, nothing fancy, that never gave us problems in the 6 years we had it. Ever. This brand new POS, on the other hand, is forcing us, for the second time in three months, to live out of a two coolers, buying ice in the morning and evening just to keep the perishables from perishing while we wait for the extended warranty company to get their act together. Great job, Frigidaire. Great job. Never again.	0

6858	I used the link to make sure that my microwave model number was correct, but the bulb is too fat to fit without bending the socket up a bit and shoving the lens on.

It needs a thinner (cylindrical, not round) bulb.	0

8128	"Bought this on a whim to satisfy my curiosity of the performance of an Induction Cooking.  Very nice, sleek, kinda short cord ~5 ft.  The fan noise is tolerable

Wished it had a temperature setting versus the vague cook mode settings.  This is the biggest gripe, cook temperature is a guess. You would think with this advance in cooking there would be a active temperature sensor.

Use my laser-sensor or a cooking digital thermometer probe to check food temps.  Makes for even and easy to monitor when cooking.

Cook top became discolored with use so it lost it's glamor, but overall a thumbs up to induction cooking!  :)"	1
280	Excellent, washing machine up...	1
296	"This unit does make ice, but there are a lot that I don't like about it.  It is noisy and runs a lot because the ice compartment isn't cold, and the ice is continually melting and refreezing (the liquid water runs from the melting ice back into the water reservoir for refreezing).  Even though the ice maker is advertised to make a lot of ice in 24 hours, the ice compartment only holds near two glasses of ice.  So the unit fills, melts, and refreezes.  At meal time, there isn't enough ice to fill the guest glasses (we are elderly, and generally it is only my wife and I at meals, but we do have family and guests).  Sometimes, the ice remains on the ""shut-off"" switch causing the freezing cycle to shut off prior to filling the small ice bin.  Other times, the ice freezes together requiring intervention or breaking and pushing to the ice into the dispenser by hand.  We do use the ice maker and for the two of us, it generally has the ice we need.  I haven't decided whether to return the item or not.  The ice maker in our refrigerator has quit working for the third time.

I took the time to supply water to this unit.  There were no instructions for doing this, but I found the installation relatively easy.  I set the unit on the counter top right next to the refrigerator and run the water into to the water input to the refrigerator - a fairly simple procedure and is out of sight.  The addition of this water supply takes away the concern of continually filling the reservoir by hand or of the unit running out of water.

Amended Review:  I have changed my review above from a 2 star to a 1 star (less if I could) because the unit failed at almost 8 months service.  I believe the shut off switch failed as the unit shows ""full on ice"" on front panel indicator.  Amazon contacted the seller for me - good for Amazon.  The seller said that they did not warrant the product beyond 40 days, and said that I should contact the manufacturer.  This doesn't look good for me, and I expect this was a waste of my money."	0
3608	Needed an ice maker to keep up with household demand especially during the summer. This model is both economical and efficient. It functions perfectly (as described) has met all our needs. We did not need all the bells and whistles - just something that made ice fast!	1
24765	The connection points (top and bottom of handle) are extremely low quality and designed to fail so you need to keep replacing the handle -- note to people thinking it is high quality because the handle is stainless steal: the actual connection points are extremely cheap/weak plastic. I have had a Samsung microwave using this handle for less than a year before it broke the first time, and then replaced it in August 2017, it is now November 2017 and the *new* handle is already broken at the same failure point. I am now ordering two more since I know the next one will fail. Very unimpressed with this cheap quality design.	0
43222	Bought this for a small apartment and didn't realize that these units are not vented. Would not have purchased it if I had seen that. Dryer takes foreverrrrrrrrrrrr and tenant complained. The wash function is fine but finally had to give up and buy an electric vented dryer that I stacked on top. Use to hear the tenant's machine running all the time and now I don't. If you have a way to vent, I would never recommend a ventless machine.	0

13917	"I've had two of these units for my shop over the past two years. The second unit seems to have had the same issue as the first. It works fine for about 3-6 months, and then the ice starts to get smaller until it no longer makes ice any longer. The first one was diagnosed as having a refrigerant leak. It was under warranty (Square Trade) and they sent me a check to replace it. The second one, now about 6 months old, is having the same issue. I need an ice maker, but I can't imagine getting a New Air again. Although I use it at my business, we only make about 4 pounds or so a week, so it's not working many hours.

A couple of other comments:
- The container in which the water is frozen into ice is very, very hard to clean, and there is no simple way to remove a top or the like to get access.
- Ice cubes of the largest size are not that large, perhaps 3/4""x1"" or so. Probably the standard for getting cubes so quickly, but still rather small.
- It is fairly quiet (especially when it's not working :-)."	0

19986	This dishwasher looks great and is awesome to be able to run smaller loads.  We essentially always had one going and the other unloading.  It does not do large items but those are probably better to hand wash anyway.  It is not a quiet dishwasher but that did not bother me.  What I did not like was the the dishes needed to be washed before put into the dishwasher.  If that was not done it was a very effective redistributor of the food put into the machine.  If I go through the trouble of washing the dishes by hand I may as well put them back on the shelf.  I would not buy this again.	0
5304	This appears to be the exact same igniter as in my Samsung NX58H5600SS/AA convection oven despite its Maytag name.  Works great in my Samsung oven for 60$ less than the so called OEM part.  We'll see how long this one lasts.  BTW, in my Samsung oven, the broil and bake igniter are the same part.  If your bake igniter went out, stick the broil igniter in the bake's place while you wait on the 2 day prime shipping.  This allowed me not to skip pizza night!	1

7575	"I needed a way to create additional space in my compact laindry room and at the same time improve the air flow from my dryer vent, which was being obstructed by the  compression of the accordian vent hose.

I checked out the offerings at the local big box home improvement center and wasn't able to find a sheet metal vent that telescoped to the length I needed.  The units that were on display were unboxed, dented and in one case, a seam was torn open.

The Builder's Best product was shipped promptly, arrived in good condition, and adjusted as needed for my installation.

Before doing the final installation, I used foil tape to seal all of the seams and close a few small air gaps to make the vent almost completely air tight.

The product was a few dollars more than other offerings, but I think the difference was worth it because of the quality."	1

8907	"Fairly easy to install, search youtube for ""134515300 installation"" and there is a great video from Appliance Pro's.
As others have said watch out for the extra light hole.  I have a LTF2940FS1, and this was shown to fit (my old seal had part numbers 1347398 (light) and 1347409 (no light)marked on it), the seal that was shipped to me contained the light hole, I did not want to return it and wait 2-3 days for another so I fixed the hole.  I measured the hole at 15/16"" with a tape measure, close enough to 1"".  I purchased two rubber plugs from Lowe's, Item # 139550 Model # 881324, these are 1"" rubber hole plugs.  They fit nice and tight from either side of the light hole but they both would not fit at the same time.  I used a utility knife to trim 1/2"" off of one plug, then they both fit in.  I was able to zip tie the plug from the back of the boot.  I am getting no leaks from the light hole with the plugs installed, this light hole is not submerged in water but is at the top and is in a wet environment (obviously), after a few weeks and 20+ loads I still have no leaks."	1

18951	"I purchased a 2-pack of the GE MWF filters.  I did receive what appear to be genuine GE MWF filters, however, neither have worked properly.  The first triggered the orange/red ""replacement"" light on my fridge within 5 days of installing it.  The filters are supposed to last around 6 months so I reset my light several times and it kept coming back on as long as that filter was in place (and it didn't with the bypass in).  I replaced that first filter with the second from the 2-pack, hoping the first was simply defective.  It's been a few days shy of a month and the water, which tasted great for about ten days started tasting terrible after that.
I made pasta with the water and it tasted like it'd been cooked in a swimming pool (chlorine).

I also use two Pur brand water containers and even when the filters are approaching the end of their life, I cannot taste chlorine in the Pur water (even if I can smell it coming out of the tap!).

I'm not sure what is up with these filters but I can't imagine there isn't something wrong with them.  GE says it must be my fridge or the light, which I doubt as it's less than two years old and prior to this was hooked up to an R/O system and at that point my fridge was not contaminating the water!  At over $30 each I certainly do not want to keep changing these out every 10-20 days.  I've considered buying more but I think I'll pay the little bit extra and get them straight from GE or a hardware store next time."	0
21067	"At any price, this compatible water filter was a waste of time and money. I purchases 3 to get a really good price, and it turned out to be a real bad purchase at any price. The filter seemed to install fine, but within a week or two, Yuk, Yuk, the water started tasting awful. Replaced it with the 2nd of three purchased, and it resulted in the same experience. Installed fine and water taste improved but within a couple weeks the water tasted like Yuk again. Replaced the 2nd with the 3rd of 3, and the water improved taste for a week or two and returned to Yuk tasking water. Thinking something must really must be wrong, I cut one filter in half with my saw. It all looked clean and nothing obviously jumped out. without resources to test the carbon filter for defects or impurities, the Yuk taste from all 3 filters was all I had to rate this product 4 THUMBS DOWN. (Can I count my two big toes as thumbs?). Some other reviewers complained of restricted water flow. My guess is the carbon filter may be sub-grade, or damaged during assembly, resulting in fragments of filter material clogging the water flow. Others have mentioned the product and packaging have no signs of certification being found for the quality or standards that should be required for any water purification product.

 In short, this UN-certified Chinese manufactured (Compatible???) product made our reasonable tasting water taste like Yuk.

49785	This is a beautiful and effective range hood. But when the installer peeled off the protective coating of the outside sleeve, we discovered there was a small, but highly visual dent in it. At first, I thought I might live with it. But every day, I saw that dent and I finally came to the conclusion that it had to be fixed. I called Amazon's customer service, and I must say, they have tried to resolve this issue. But Firebird refused to play ball. They said they would replace the sleeve and give me a 15% return on the purchase price. But that didn't do me any good. I still had hire an installer to remove the sleeve and replace it with the new one. It will cost $100. Firebird has stopped communicating with me and Amazon. Shame on them. They have insurance for shipping mishaps. Why should the extra expense of re-installing the sleeve.  fall on my shoulders.  Amazon has suggested that I try to sell the damaged range hood and they would replace it. But it still leaves me with the expense of uninstalling the old one and installing the new one. They have suggested a complete refund, but again, that leaves me with the responsibility of purchasing a new range hood and installing it. FIREBIRD doesn't stand by it's products. I purchased this with the expectation of a pristine range hood. I look at that dent every day and it's makes me crazy.	0

4413	"I hate when things are built to fail and it seems like this spray arm is one of those things. That in itself isn't worth a bad review, because if you read through the reviews obviously people are satisfied with this thing, but it IS frustrating to fit. Heaven forbid they build it right the first time, but instead when you buy this ""equivalent"" (better) replacement part it will hardly fit. I was just about to return it because I thought i bought the wrong one, having the exact same problem as others trying to screw it on. I started trying some of the methods (before i read the reviews) but gave up thinking I had bought the wrong one as I said. Now that i know it will go on I'll either have to hold the piece down with metal (I tried with plastic and it didn't have enough resistance) or I'll have to take out the washer and hold it down from on top. Either way, while everything will probably work (I haven't done it yet but imagine I'll get it tomorrow) I think it deserves a bad review for the aforementioned reasons; Also when I have a part that won't fit or something confusing about a product I look for bad reviews so someone can explain it. Hope that explains why I am giving it a bad review and I hope you found this useful. If you need it buy it. But always take note of the companies that build poor quality appliances."	0
